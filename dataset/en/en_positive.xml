For all you buff, rough, and tuff athletes out there, this is an excellent source of protein to get you boosted up for your game! Need a little extra edge? This protein supplement comes in double rich chocolate, chocolate mint, pina colada, strawberry and vanilla so your taste buds will be singing just like your results! I know, I use this stuff and I think it's really improved my endurance for both my tennis game and my three times a week five mile jogs.

Totally great!  Easy installation, very very nice quality.  Very good price for what you get.  Keeps my two boxers from rushing to the front door to greet the guests.   Especially for the two three year old grandkids that don't really like the kisses from the Boxers.

This espresso maker works just as I expected: Perfectly fine.  It's simple and intuitive.  It works fine for pulling 1-2 shots at a time.  The reheat cycle is about a minute, so if you're making more, by the time you clean out the spent grounds and reload, the machine is ready for you.  After making 1-2 shots, the machine needs about 2 minutes to get the steamer ready.  The steamer works well.  Complaints about the wand height and length are apparently from people who insist on using whatever milk pot they have rather than one that fits.  Not having one, I've been using my Pyrex 1-cup measuring cup which works well.  I froth 1/3 cup milk which becomes a full (overflowing) cup of steamed milk and some foam.  End result?  Tasty espresso with good cream, and lattes or cappuccino with little fuss.  I'm quite happy with this under $100 machine.  It's perfect for 1-2 people who don't drink tons of espresso.  It's also pretty quiet and cleans up easily.  Daily use for about a month.

The workout is definitely tough. It takes time to learn choreography. I got my DVD yesterday and so far I've learned the first combination (took me about an hour to be comfortable with it and do it up to speed with Tracy, and I do not have any dance background). I did notice that the arm movements in actual performance of the combination in the first combo are different from the moves Tracy teaches, but once you are familiar with the rest of the combo you'll not find it difficult to learn the proper arm movements. The workout is very fun! And I love the fact that she doesn't talk throughout the actual workout. I had been doing Jillian Michaels routine prior to getting Tracy's DVD's, and to be honest, after the first couple of weeks of Jillian I knew each word she was gonna say and exact second of when she'll say it. It became boring and I felt like I was in the army. Tracy's workout is very different and makes you feel like a woman! I feel sexy doing it. I can't wait to learn all the combo's and I'm up for the challenge! I can barely do the first combo making sure it lasts the whole song. I am in a pretty good shape, because I ran 10km every single day! This workout is tough but I fell in love with it from the moment I put it on!

I have a Linksys BEFSR41 wired router, so when I started bringing my wireless work laptop home, I decided that I needed to get a wireless access point rather than another (wired/wireless)router. Basic setup was simple; I was up and running in ten minutes with the very basic documentation. I am a pc tech for a hospital, so I have more than the ordinary skill needed to configure the WAP. Even so, I downloaded the docs from Linksys' site to be sure that I'd done everything properly. I hadn't. While I'd set the encryption, I hadn't turned off brodcasting the access point's name. A really good hacking program could have gotten access.
Definitely download the documentation from Linksys' site.

I have to say I have been pleasantly surprised by these wipes! With a new baby in the house, we went thru several brands of sensitive wipes (Pampers, Huggies, Target generic and Kirtlands). I found these wipes to be stronger and hold their moisture better than any of the other brands we tried. Overall they are a better performing product than any of the other wipes. 
 
My only comment is that buyers should not expect the wipes to be as strong as wipes made for older babies or toddler.  However, we like them so much we have started using them on our toddler. Though it is a matter of personal opinion (and after becoming more educated on the topic) we feel that the lack of fragrance, synthetic ingredients and a lower impact on the environment is worth the switch.

Just needed something to play video, and use for my online classes. This fit the bill! It's lighter than a textbook and does a lot more in my opinion ha.

This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)
      
I am 35yr old mother of two.  I LOVED THIS BOOK.  This isn't the normal type of book i read at all.  I bought this book within hours of finishing Twilight.  
It was fantastic.  Not a disappointment at all.  It is so well written that i could feel physical pain for the way Bella suffered in the book.  I have read it twice in two weeks.  I am on pins and needles waiting for the next in the series... in the mean time i will re-read Romeo and Juliette.  Fall 2007 will not come soon enough.
If you enjoyed this as much as i have, go to the authors website for more.. she has extras and outtakes that didn't make it into the book.  It prolongs the joy of reading this just a bit longer.
Thank you Stephenie for sharing a great talent.

This is just one of many Blu-Ray movies that i have purchased that has given me a great movie experience, personally i feel that even in the movie theaters you don't get the HD experience that a Blu-Ray movie gives you. The Transformers movie gives you an awsome look at how much detail you can see because of the HD quality. You can actually see the littlest of details in the mechanics of the different moving parts in the robots. Just awesome!! Also the prompt delivery of your product, amazon will let you know the approximate date of delivery and will probably get there before the date of arrival. All in all i have had a great experience with Amazon.

Replacement blades don't really seem to help that much on other electric razors I have used.  But, the Braun instructions say to replace the foil and cutter every 18 months.  When I finally replaced mine (22 months) it was amazing how much better the razor worked.  It was really like getting a new razor.  It runs much smoother and slip along my aging skin like silk again.  If you have one of these Braun razors and find it is not a smooth and comfortable as it once was, the Foil and Cutter refill may do the trick for you.

<review id="17" label="1">
After years of hearing this graphic novel lauded as one of the greatest comics of all time (and admittedly intrigued by the buzz surrounding the upcoming film adaptation), I finally sat down and read Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' magnum opus.  
And I was blown away.  
Absolutely, completely enthralled and blown away by this "comic book" that transcends the boundaries and stigmas attached to its medium to become a truly compelling piece of literature, as stimulating and thought provoking as the works of Dickens or Faulkner.
I should point out that while I have always been a fan of superheroes, I am not an avid comic book reader; in fact, "Watchmen" is the first graphic novel I've ever purchased.  I state this to illustrate that this is a work that can be enjoyed by anyone, not just comic book enthusiasts.  
Everything about this book, even 20+ years after its original publication, is thrillingly fresh and compelling.  Set in an alternate 1985 where Richard Nixon is serving his third term as president, one of the novel's many pleasures is seeing just how thoroughly thought out every aspect of this alternate history is.  The story begins with the murder of a former masked hero (the book fittingly avoids the term "superhero," as only one of the characters has supernatural abilities), and what starts as a whodunit quickly escalates into a meditation on power, government, politics, technology, and the direction humanity is headed.  Yes, the Cold War-era nuclear-holocaust material slightly dates the tale, but the theme of mankind's ever growing ability to destroy ourselves is still relevant today.
Yet for all its philosophizing, "Watchmen" remains firmly grounded in character study, and the costumed adventurers found withing are given incredibly complex psychologies.  Everyone is a realistically flawed human being doing their best to figure out their place in the world.  By the novel's end, you come to understand all the characters, even the ones who have done the most horrific things (including an attempted rape and some graphic murders).  Moore and Gibbons do not pass judgment on their characters, leaving the reader to ultimately decide how he or she feels about each one.
The way the narrative is told is absolutely riveting, filled with flashbacks and concurrent scenes juxtaposed to maximum artistic effect.  And in between each chapter is a wealth of supplemental materials to fill in the gaps of the novel's backstory, each done in the fashion of  publications that exist in the Watchmen world (newspaper clippings, excerpts from fake novels, etc.).  And artist Dave Gibbons expertly supports Moore's text with detailed artwork packed with symbolism and hidden meanings.  You could easily spend hours pouring over the panels to find small symbolic details and hints of future plot twists.  The final panel alone masterfully and succintly brings the work full-circle and is chilling in its implications.
In short, anyone who is a fan of literature (not just comic books) needs to read "The Watchmen."  While I have high hopes for the film adaptation, it cannot hope to match the complexity, breadth, and depth of the source material.  This is one of the most stimulating books I have read in a long time, and I cannot recommend it highly enough.

I originally had a Brookstone pedometer that was not accurate at all (like for every 1 step, it counted 2-3), so someone told me about this one and I ordered it right away. It is soooooooooooooooo accurate. For the whole day, it might be off by like a few steps, but nothing to worry about. The only thing I dont like about it is that it is huge compared to other pedometers, but I would rather have it big and accurate than not. I would definitely recommend this pedometer to everyone.

I purchased this to replace a 5 section rotating feeder that I used when I was away from home.  I consider my cat bulemic, especially when left home alone, he will overeat and then I come home to multiple piles of wet kitty kibble...  This product has solved these issues.
The feeder holds plenty of food for multiple feedings.  The adjustable settings go from to 1/4 to 2 cups per feeding and allows 1 to 3 feedings per day at times you set.  The base is heavy enough (add the batteries before you judge) to keep my cat from tipping it or moving it.
The controls are a little tough to get use to, reminiscent of a digital multifunction wristwatch, so hold on to your directions.
Overall, I would recommend this product to others.  This is feeder number 3 for me and paying the higher price has solved many of the problems of cheaper units.

My husband and I got our first Sonicare over 10 years ago and it is still going strong.  We've always kept our brushes in the charger plugged in and have never had a problem.  On vacations we take it with us and it has always worked fine.
I feel we certainly have had our money's worth.  We've used the it so much that the Sonicare name has worn off the unit.  I know one of these days it will bite the dust but we will definitely buy another, probably this model.  I feel the Sonicare does an excellent job of cleaning the teeth &amp; gums.  Our oral health has much improved since those years of using a regular toothbrush.  We highly recommend the Sonicare.

This really seems to help my maltese's eyes.  The reddish tearing has pretty much stopped.  The only problem is that she does not like the taste, so she won't eat it sprinkled on her food.

My husband comes from a long line of crepe makers so I got this appliance for his birthday.  At first he rolled his eyes at it (as a purist who likes to flip).  With two little girls, though, we found the play value of this crepe maker to be great.  It's so easy to use, he actually brought it to the dining room table so he could eat while he cooked.  When we had guests, he had this machine going, along with two stove-top pans.  He could make crepes 2-3x faster with this machine versus the stove top.  The crepes are thinner using this method, but that didn't seem to be a problem.  Only thing I'd change about this product would be to make the dipping pan of something other than plastic.  I kept feeling paranoid that I'd melt the plastic when I dipped the hot pan into it.  Overall, though, I'd highly recommend this product.  In fact, we're buying it as a Christmas present for each of my husband's siblings.

You get two, which could last up to a year.  Not bad, the price is right, I've seen these at membership stores for $17.00.  You'll need them.  
For extra cleaning, dip your loaded toothbrush into a cup of baking soda, it's a gentle abrasive and aids in bringing the teeth up.  Sure makes the teeth feel clean.  
If you have a 50 year mouth (like mine) and have taken coffee and tea for many moons, a professional whitening may be in order but I'm not laying out a grand for the procedure.  I'm into the hygeine aspect of sonic care, and sonic care really does take care of teeth and gums.  Gums are often over brushed and wear down or neglected altogether, so remember...Sonic care for health, and looks.  But there is a point in life when you either accept the aging and yellow hue or shell out some cash for a cosmetic cleaning procedure.

I ordered this item after my old ceramic iron stopped heating. I heard about the CHI brand and read some great reviews so I decided to give it a try. This iron is well worth its price! When I first got the iron I was concerned about the weight. It was lighter than what I was used to with my old iron, which made me think it was made cheaper and that it would not work as well. I was more wrong than ever! The light weight of this iron makes it very easy to use and it works wonderfully! It heats up very quick and It never takes me more than 10 minutes to get all of my curly hair silky straight! Non-ceramic hair irons that I have used in the past generally did not hold up against humidity, and my hair would be curly again but that will never happen with this iron! I recommend this iron for anyone who is looking for the best hair tools! Also, I suggest protecting your hair with CHI iron guard when using this product.

I have a toy breed dog that uses puppy pads in a litter box instead of going outside. I have tried just about every brand of puppy pad in an effort to find one that is absorbent and odor resistant. These are the best I have found for the price. I am very pleased with the product. Other products are scented in order to mask the odors and smell horrible right out of the box. These are unscented but still manage to keep odors at bay despite being soiled for several hours. The reseller, DigItPet, shipped my order quickly and correctly.

So, I read the reviews, but we were despirate and bought it anyways.  Ours works great!  Two months in, it doesn't skip their meals, the cats let us sleep past 7 am, and they don't bother us for food.  I'm actually amazed that my one little trouble-maker hasn't figured out how to make the food come out.  The two downfalls I've found are: 1) you can only set one meal size, so you can either have 1/4 cup three times a day or 1/2 cup three times a day, and the one is too little and the other is too much; and 2) you can only set up to 3 feedings a day.  We've made it work, though.  We give them 1/4 cup at 6 am, 12 pm, and 12 am, and then we manually give them 1/4 cup using the feeder at 6 pm.
I can honestly say that after reading the reviews, I was afraid it was going to be a lemon, but if you don't mind making some compromises, I think it is an excellent item, esp for feeding when you want to sleep!  The programming wasn't so hard, and once you figure it out, it's easy to remember.

This review is from: Pinocchio (Disney Gold Classic Collection) (DVD)
      
This film continues to be the standard against which all animation is measured. To think of all the hours spent in producing all the hand-drawn perfection seen in this film is staggering. Equal notice should be taken of the exceptional score and songs, themselves award-winning. "When You Wish Upon A Star" is so universally known today, one tends to forget it came from this film.The story of Pinnochio, the little wooden puppet given life for Geppeto the toy maker by the Blue Fairy is well-known. The intensity of the artwork and the tenseness of the story make it immortal. To be honest, very little children should watch with a parent, as some scenes are pretty scary, but I absolutely adore this film.Looking at the film today, it's so hard to believe it's over 60 years old! The picture transfer is flawless, and the soundtrack is superb. I do regret one thing: the complete lack of extras on this disc. One would think such an important film to the Disney studios would have been given more of a send-off to DVD, but really that's all I didn't like about the disc.Please, pay no attention to the lack of extras, just get the DVD for the film itself. Believe me, it's so very worth it!

This has 4 or 5 stars from almost everyone, but I'll inject a couple
of caveats.  I'd have given it 2 stars if it had been $100 rather than
$50.
Both ours and my sisters are loud.  It sounds like the motor/bearings are
very cheap.  The KitchenAid one that works with your mixer is quieter.
The KitchenAid is $69 for just the bowl, but I'd definitely choose
it over this one IF you already have a mixer.
The bowl is breakable.  kitchenaid one has heavier plastic outside.
Capacity isn't huge.  Kitchenaid does about 2 qts.  For most of the 
recipes we've done, the Cuisinart ends up overflowing after it's churned.
However, for $50, it's great for making ice cream with the kids or the
occasional bowl of something special.  Much better than the old tub
with ice and salt that I remember from the 70's.  (but man, did that ice 
cream taste good after you waited for it for HOURS)

The new Battlestar Galactica is one of the most adult and intelligent SF series I have ever seen. Season 2.0 continues the tradition of excellence. It is true that this is relatively expensive compared to the full season 1 (which came with the mini series), but the quality of the storyline makes up for it. A big difference with much SF is that it is more character-driven than plot driven. This makes the show interesting for a broader audience.

With all the junk in the market these days, I'd been dreading the purchase of a new computer for a long while until I found the Lenovo Ideapad S10 "large capacity" model. (Mine's black.) Even though I paid full MSRP, I think it's the best value on the market.
My only real complaint is with keyboard layout. I would like to be able to hold the Fn key to use the left and right arrow keys for Home and End, and the up and down arrows for PgUp and PgDn. Given how complete the keyboard is, I'm also surprised that there isn't a "mute" key.
For desktop use, I connect a full-size USB keyboard and plug in a monitor, which gives me a second desktop. Having only 2 USB ports is a little tight, especially since I usually keep a Bluetooth adapter in one and a CDMA modem in the other.
The Atom and aggressive power management perform well for only a 3-cell battery, giving me usually about 2 hours of use on a full charge. I often use my S10 in my car (and with the addition of a Velco strip, it sits on my Subaru's cup holder), giving me music, Internet email and Web (via a USB CDMA modem), GPS, etc.; on longer trips, I plug the AC adapter into a small inverter. I'm also pleased to see that there's a third-party 6-cell battery available on Amazon.
Windows XP comes installed, but erroneously indicates two processors, though it's really just due to the hyperthreading ability of the one Atom N270 processor. I'm a little annoyed that Lenovo did not include a Windows XP installation CD (even though the S10 has not CD drive), but haven't yet called them for one. (I find that Windows often requires re-installation.)
The 160GB HDD is a Hitachi (my favorite brand, and not surprising since Lenovo and Hitachi are both effectively ex-IBM). The overhead and one-touch restore feature leave only about 100 GiB usable, which is still plenty, even after installing Fedora 10 Linux to make it dual-boot. (Doing this was surprisingly easy, as I could boot from a USB memory drive while trying it, then didn't need to erase anything to repartition the HDD and install Linux.)
Little kids especially like the built-in camera.
The Lenovo Ideapad S10 "large capacity" is the best computer deal I've found.

I know that I give this office 5 stars because I never used the older versions that the other reviewers did.  I did have to take the tutorials.
I have really enjoyed the office and it has been a great learning experience. Other reviewers that gave the Office low scores were the ones that had the older version.  They had a lot of changes and a lot of new things to learn which they did not enjoy.
I can say that if you never used any other version of office you will enjoy the 2007 full version.
You do have to take the tutorials to get the full benefits of the office.

Eclipse is another great addition to the Twilight series. I could feel Jacob's pain in what he felt for Bella, I could feel Edward's pain in that he could see Bella loved someone else and he wasnt sure at one stage who she was going to choose. I felt Bella's pain in how she finally realised that she loved Jacob too and that she had to tell him that her choice is Edward as she cant live without him. I didnt like the love triangle at first as I knew that Bella and Edward were meant to be together however i can see how Bella needed to know exactly what she was giving up to be with Edward. The book was filled with a few funny moments especially when bella,jacob and Edward are in a tent together and its freezing and Bella's reaction to Jacob kissing her. A great book!!!! I recommend it.

My daughter was the most happy when she was in her Halo.  I love these sleep blankets, the cotton ones for use in Florida weather were just perfect and then the colder months the toasty warm fleece.  I wish they would have come in a longer size since she outgrew them in height well before the weight limits.  I recommend them for anyone who wants a good night sleep, your baby will always be just warm enough and not to warm in these fantastic sleepers.

My husband and I have really enjoyed this toaster.  The hard cooked eggs are the best I've ever eaten; they come out much better than hard boiled eggs.  The toaster is easy to use and looks nice.  Just put in a split English muffin, water in the well, break the egg into the little pan, put a pre-cooked sausage on top, add the lid, and turn it on.  Go make the bed, and come back to the kitchen, and breakfast is ready!  Easy clean-up too.

Batman is back with a vengeance! Everyone did an awesome job, especially Heath Ledger as the psychopathic Joker! The Joker is both funny and scary. Other than Batman, The Joker was my favorite character! I'm surprised they had Harvey Dent being Two-Face and becoming a bad guy in this movie. I thought they would save him for the 3rd one. If you are hard-core Batman fans, you'll love THE DARK KNIGHT!!!

To my knowledge this is one of the rare wireless adapters (usb) that are compatible with vista x64. I was looking for hours, and it was looking grim, I called linksys and this is the only adapter they have that is compatible with Microsoft Windows Vista x64. I bought it, installed it using the drivers provided on cd, and its working just fine, 130mbps connection speed when used in combination with my WRT160N.

So I've had my HF10 for about a month now. I'm extremely impressed with video and audio quality. Provided you are shooting with enough light, playback in full 1080P is amazing. Low light performance leaves a little to be desired. Autofocus hunts a little too much, again mostly in low light. The onboard light casts a strange blue glow that my wife calls "The Alien Abduction Cam". 
The camera is extremely light (other reviews have said the HF10 is about the size of a beer can - true that). Both my wife and I have no issues with the size. She has small hands, mine are a little ogrish. 
The fact that the PS3 directly supports playback from the SDHC cards is a major bonus (I'm assuming other Blu-Ray players with SDHC slots will do the same). No need to burn off to a DVD just to check out something you've just shot. 
As for the AVCHD codec. Argh, what a pain it is to try and edit this stuff. The codec requires lots of horsepower to edit natively and converting to HDV or WMV/AVI either takes too much time or lots of HD space. There are plenty of solutions out there that will edit AVCHD natively, but most of them are just plain garbage. I've tried several suites - Vegas, ULead, Studio Plus - but have found them to be unstable or user-unfriendly. I typically use Premiere Elements 4 on my PC for this stuff, but Adobe doesn't yet support AVCHD. 
For now, I've been backing up the raw M2TS files to a couple of mirrored external back-up drives on my PC, then using iMovie 2008 on a MacBookPro to convert to Apple's Intermediate Code (dropping from 1920x1080 to 960x540 in the process - yes, you WILL notice). From there, its all easy editing but its still a painful workaround. Hopefully, Apple and Adobe will add direct support for AVCHD in the future, but then...I was thinking the same thing last year. 
If you can overlook those issues (I almost couldn't, which is why I didn't get an AVCHD 'corder last year), you'll be rewarded with some spectacular video.

I grew out of space to store my videos and captured footage. I bought this large capacity drive to solve that problem, and it has worked.
It was very easy to install on my desktop Mac. It has worked flawlessly out of the box, and the price was very competitive. I have used it for about one month so far.
I read reviews which told me that it was a little noisy and I thought that this would not bother me. I agree that the noise is not loud. It is a mild continuous background hum. But I was wrong.... It does get to me. The noise never goes away, and is the only drawback to this neat, small footprint, shiny black repository of huge amounts of data.

I am very impressed with the new microsoft office. Office Home and Strudent Edition is very cheap, but it comes with full versions of the most essential office programs, namely Word, Excel, and Powerpoint. It also comes with OneNote, but I have not used that program. One of the greatest features in Microsoft WOrd is the ability to create citations for papers on the fly, alnog with bibliographies or works cited pages.  Word allows you to chose the citation style, i.e. MLA, chicago, etc... And then provides a form based on what kind of thing you are citing, i.e. book, web site, journal, periodical, etc... You just fill in the blanks and bam! Word inserts citiations for you and creates your works cited page. Very easy and very convienient. Just make sure you save all of your  work in windows 97 to 2003 mode, otherwise older versions of office won't be able to open them.

The Flip Mino is small--very small and very light weight. It fits comfortably in my pocket and isn't a bother to tote around for hours at a time. The soft pouch that comes with it is very handy and can double as a cloth for wiping fingerprints and smudges off of the unit and screen.
The video quality is good--like a VHS tape that's been used over-and-over again, but with pixely artifacts, rather than a drifting image and fuzz. If you keep the camera still and if the subject of the shot isn't moving too much and if the lighting is decent, the image quality is really quite good--I would compare it to standard definition television. Overall, it's better than your average YouTube video. And though the image does become grainy in low light, it's still suitable for capturing candid moments. 
The sound quality is also good and the microphone is suitably sensitive. It picks up quiet speech without too much background noise and there is never a hiss or buzz.
I put together a 30 minute video for SLG Publishing that was shot entirely with the Flip Mino at Comic-con International 2008. I used my MacBook Pro (the newest 15 inch version--purchased in May of 2008) and I edited the video with iMovie. I had to install the Flip video codec that came on the camera's flash drive and I updated iMovie to the latest version of the software, 7.1.4. After taking these steps, everything worked great. I found that the best way to manage the video was to import it using iPhoto (my MacBook Pro recognized the Flip as a camera and automatically opened iPhoto to import the video). iMovie will then add the video to its library for editing.
Overall, my experience with the Flip Mino has been very possitive. It works as it is supposed to and that's really what I want when I buy electronics.
Here's a link to the first part of the video that I made. It might help you to see what the video quality looks like. However, the video has been compressed a second time and is not indicative of the native video quality of the flip.

I have this router in my basement and can access the network from anywhere in my 2 story house.  Occasionally the router will hang, although that may be because of our Cable modem issues - however it is simple to unplug it and wait 30 seconds before plugging back in.  Web interface is not as user friendly as I have seen, but is powerful enough for any home users to set up their own wireless networks.  I wish they had a built in print server but that is minor considering it would have added at least $20 to the price, and can be purchased seperately. Probably still the best home 802.11g router available for performance, reliability and price.

This brush was used on our new malamute-mix dog, who has the heavy double-coat of the northern working breeds. Before it was used on him, every stroke of the hand over his coat let little puffs of soft white undercoat go flying into the air and onto our clothes. After a good brushing with the Furminator, in which two packed shopping bags of fur were removed, the shedding is VASTLY reduced, to a much more livable level.
  I've had other double-coated dogs and used a variety of brushes and combs, grooming for an hour or so every few days in shedding season, taken bags of fur off the dogs, but still had fur come off while stroking the dog afterward. The Furminator seems different in that the fur quit shedding after the same amount of fur was removed, which is the partly the point of the grooming in the first place.
 I don't own one of these yet but since dog hair blowing around the house in puffy scads is irritating, I plan to get one after a little price-shopping. It is impressive what a difference the Furminator made this malamute's coat. It's softer and smoother and he looks so beautiful now.

I heard a commercial for this about 3 or 4 times one evening, and I finally paid attention after barely listening to it the first few times.  Once I saw that it had interchangeable, *dishwasher-safe* plates, I told my husband that I wanted it for Christmas.  I popped over here to amazon and ordered it right away.  It got here before Christmas, but since it was my gift, I had to leave it alone until afterwards ;-)
A few things attracted me to the grill.  Interchangeable plates, dishwasher safe, and the waffle plates.  I had been looking for a new wafflemaker, and in fact had looked at the store the night I saw the ad for the G5.  The one we've had for 11+ years is too small for our family now, and I wanted something bigger.  However, it seemed silly to spend a lot of money on one since I don't make them that often.  Imagine how happy I was to see the size of the plates on the commercial!  
Let me tell you, I was not disappointed with my first waffle go-round a couple of days ago.  It makes 2 waffles that are each just about the size of 2 typical square freezer waffles.  That's what I'm talking about!  I made up a batch of Bisquick waffle batter, and set to cooking.  It was trial and error as far as learning cooking times.  I like my waffles softer, my husband likes them crispier.  I would say on average they needed to cook 5-7 minutes.  I pre-heated the grill as directed, and poured about 1.5 ladles of batter on each side.  I didn't get them perfectly full each time, but close enough, you know?  We ate them, we liked them!  I didn't have any issues with them cooking unevenly; each batch turned out just fine.
Yesterday my husband made grilled cheese using the steak plate and the baking tray (upper &amp; lower).  He tells me that he flipped it over so he'd have the same design on each side *insert rolly eyes here*, but otherwise it cooked just fine.
Last night I made chocolate chip cookies using the recipe from the cookbook that came with the grill.  So cool!  They were virtually impossible to screw up!  I did cook them longer than the recipe called for after the first batch; cooking times I think are are things that will have to be judged individually for each recipe.  There are guidelines in the cookbook and the instruction manual, but I don't think they're hard and fast.  Experiment and see what works best for you :-)
This morning my husband was at it again, this time making scrambled eggs.  I didn't get any (he ate them all while I was asleep!) but he says that they cooked the eggs in about 1/3 of the time as our gas stove.  He was pretty happy with that.
I was pleased with the 2 drip trays and the better spatulas (also 2) that came with the grill, in addition to the cleaning sponge.  I don't know how often I'll use the sponge, since the plates clean so easily by hand (and once again, they are dishwasher-safe!), but it's nice to have.  I liked the other Foreman grills, but cleaning them stopped me from using them as often as I might have otherwise.  They were just kind of a pain; if you've used them you know what I mean.
Get this grill :-)  If you have realistic expectations and are willing to experiment to get just the right cooking times, then I don't think you'll be disappointed.  I'm not!

My mother in law has a CHI Iron, and she paid almost $200 dollars. Sometimes I borrowed it, and it was exactly like the one used in the hair salon, I wanted to buy it, but it simply looked too expensive, so when I saw it in Amazon at $70 dlls I just bought it, I received it very fast, and I noticed that although the box and the iron look the same, the material that is made is different (not the ceramic plates, but the black material), is ligther than the one of my mother in law, but still works great, my hair becomes smooth and silky. To me, it makes sense the difference in the material, cause is cheaper, but the main function does not have a problem, I recomend it.

I've been a fan of Norelco razors and used them for about 15 years.  I've never had problems with them and frankly the main reason for not using the same razor for the whole time is that I have wanted the "upgrades" available in newer razors after a few years either more battery life or newer shaving head, such as the Spectra which is superior to the older styles.  Their replacement heads are very easy to change and the new heads make a significant difference in closeness.  I highly recommend that you replace the heads on an annual basis for best shaving quality/closeness and don't take a chance with replacement heads that are not Norelco OEM products.

I have two cats. One has very thick, long hair that mats very easily and he was leaving hair all over the house from his shedding.  The other one has somewhat long hair that is silky and doesn't mat at all and doesn't shed too much. The furminator works great on the thick-haired cat. It gets out the dead hair that is trapped.  The first time I used it I had a pile of hair as big as the cat. I can use it once a week and not have hair everywhere from his shedding.  On the other cat it just kind of skims over the top and doesn't seem to get much hair out.  So it really depends on the kind of hair that your cat has.  I have tried lots of grooming tools and this is the best one I have ever used.

I have a 70-lb German Shepherd who, like all dogs in her breed, sheds so much that within a month there would be so much fur you could use it to stuff a pillow. We vacuum once or twice every day but there are still tufts of fur rolling around the house like tumbleweeds.
I bought the medium-sized brush. It is a good size for her. Within five strokes through her coat, I had gotten enough fur to completely fill a normal slicker brush. Try to use this outside (and don't wear anything nice) because the fur will stick to everything. I imagine it feels good for the dog, because mine stood there the entire time- even though she has the attention span of a four-year old human. 
This tool is amazing!

OK.
So I was initially looking at the Wireless-N version of this router, to potentially replace my old WRT54GS (Linksys Wireless G Router with SpeedBooster).  That router had problems, admittedly so.  It worked, but not as well as I'd liked given my setup.  Since all of my devices are either G or B wireless, I figured I would just settle for the G router and save money (this one is almost half the cost of the N router).
For the record I've got a laptop (wireless), media server (wireless), PS3 (wireless), PSP (wireless), DS (wireless), EEE PC (wireless), PS2 (hardwire), 360 (hardwire), printer (hardwire), and DirecTV HR20 (hardwire).  Yeah, I know.  What's important: the media server is in the master bedroom's closet, far from the router, which is in the living room.  With my old router, signal strength got weak through walls, extremely weak.  Local network activity was painful, streaming movies from the media center was painful as it would frequently lock up and stutter; thumbnails would not load.
Enter this router.  First thing to note: the CD is NOT required.  If you're new to wireless connections you may want to just follow the directions and CD, but if you're comfortable with navigating the router web interface, just bypass the CD and set it up like you normally would; it'll work.  Setup was quite painless and recognition was fast, I managed to replace my old wireless network in a matter of minutes.  There is also a feature that allows for a WiFi Protected Setup with a one-button press, but apparently the receivers require that feature to be built in as well - and none of mine did.  Therefore I just ignored it.  For those who are setting up for the first time and bought receivers with the feature included, they might find it useful when doing the setup.
I immediately noticed an improvement in the local networking speed.  The aforementioned media server is now screaming fast over the network; thumbnails load just as fast as if I'm at the machine, file transfers are nowhere near as slow and streaming content plays with minimal lag.  Internet connectivity was also slightly improved on devices that were not close to the router.
There are a couple of issues, not necessarily the router's fault, but more an issue with the way Linksys designs them.  First, getting internet connectivity took way too long and was not as easy as it should have been.  I had to powercycle my modem to get it to pull the IP information - even though the details should have easily been accessible from the previous router having gotten them.  This might be a Time Warner issue rather than a Linksys issue - maybe it sees a different MAC and freaks, but I doubt it.  Once I got the IP information, the router still would not give internet connectivity for a minute.  I'm using Vista Premium so I can tell when it's "Local", "Internet" or both and it struggled to get both up.
Second, and a minor nitpick at best, the power cord is easily half the size of the WRT54GS.  For the life of me I can't understand this.  It makes it hard for me to locate the router in a good place, because I like to have the router on the UPS, and by shortening the cord I have to have the router in the middle of the floor.  Minor issue, but still a problem for me.
Otherwise, I highly recommend this.  It seems they fixed the majority of the problems the previous devices had.  I noted that the negative reviews came from people who had support problems; I never call the Bombay support line, so I have nothing bad to say.

I saw this advertised on Amazon for a whopping ===$18.74=== and realized it'd be foolish not to try.  The product was shipped quickly and relatively easy to set up; it took about 10 minutes to read the manual, measure the average distance of my steps, and then program it all into the Omron.
This pedometer is fairly accurate, lightweight, and easy to use.  I find that it helps me keep track of my daily exercise levels, and is a subtle reminder sometime when I need to step it up.  Haha, pun intended.  Anyway.  The only complaint I have is that there's no light or beeping timer feature on this device.  I do a lot of walking in the evening and I don't always have a light handy to read the pedometer.  Also, I like to run for set time periods and having to actually manually check the amount of time I've been at it can be a little frustrating.  It loses a star for those things, but otherwise I've found this to be both accurate and helpful as I track my fitness level.
I recommend this to anyone who just wants to monitor their activity and maybe measure progress in terms of getting more active.  You can definitely keep track with all of the simple but effective features provided in this device.

I read a lot about this machine before I bought it so I was somewhat prepared for its shortcomings, but I have to say they didn't bother me nearly as much as I expected they would. The steam wand is a little close to the counter, but not to the point that I even notice it. It is a relatively small machine overall, but that is to be expected in this price range. I think for the price, it makes awesome coffee. I had a Starbucks machine that cost around $200 that never made coffee as well as this machine. The coffee itself has a great crema and the milk tastes like it has been frothed in a cafe. I am really happy with my purchase.

I love our Petsafe wireless fence system for the most part.  My only hesitation is with the fact that from time to time the collar will beep without a cause that I can recognize.  I'm never sure if it's a weak battery or a signal interruption of some type.  It does keep our dog in our yard.  Much cheaper than building a fence.

My dog is almost 15 years old, but on the recommendation of my vet, I started her on Synovi G3.  The results were astounding.  She is more energetic, more active and much less fearful.  Lately, she's been running, leaping and generally acting more like a puppy than I thought possible.  Also -- she thinks they taste great.  Totally cool.

yes, there has been deafening hype and marketing surrounding the fusion, but guess what? the damn thing is pretty amazing. it really does provide a crazy close shave with little to no irritation. yes, the blades are pricey, but hey, it's your face! you could keep hacking away with cheap Bic razors, but do you really hate your face that much? 
   P.S. I am also a head shaver, and this thing is very well adapted to the scalp.

I threw my George Foreman grill away.  My house would smell so gross I would get sick to my stomach not to mention the fact that whatever my husband and I grilled was tough as leather and dry not to mention the clean up was horrible.  We received this grill last week and used it.  Hubby and I love it!! It has a tempature control unit so things that need to cook slower will be cooked according to your taste.  The clean up is super easy and this will be used a lot! The instruction booklet comes with instructions and temperature settings for all kinds of meat.  This is a great size grill for larger families too!   Well done Sanyo...Well done!!! I highly recommend this for anyone especially those that haven't had good experiences with George Foreman grills.

Ditto to everything everyone has said.  Right now, I'm suffering from a sore throat, and this kettle arrived just in the nick of time for me, as I am drinking alot of herbal tea.  Unlike others, I am happy it makes noise when it is just ready to quit boiling.  I can be doing other things in the other room and know when to go get my tea.  And no annoying high pitched whistle.

I ordered this toaster from Amazon and it arrived full of scratches and one nasty dent. They exchanged it for me with no problem but the second one had more scratches than the first one did and had a horrid, can't miss it dent on the front with a matching one on the rear, directly behind the first one at the same height. Amazon informed me they couldn't exchange it for me again so I just returned it and ordered one from Macy's. The one I received from Macy's arrived in great shape. The only flaws were ones from the mold used in the casting process, to be expected, and not big deal. It looks very cool and makes excellent toast. It's nice not having to use my oven broiler with a need to flip the bread over after one side is down plus need to closely watch it so it doesn't burn. Having this making toast under a broiler made me realize what a genius the inventor of the toaster was. Forget Einstein. Praises to Charles Strite, inventor of the Pop Up toaster. Pop up toasters didn't really make it big until the introduction of Wonder Bread, the first sliced bread to hit the market. After the introduction of Wonder Bread, Strite's toasters just flew off the shelves. Hmmmm remember Window's Flying Toaster screen saver?

This review is from: Darby O'Gill &amp; The Little People (VHS Tape)
      
I've been a film fanatic all my life and to some degree I credit good ould Darby O'Gill for that. I was a guest at the world premiere on the 24th of June 1959 in the Theatre Royal Dublin. Walt Disney was there along with Albert Sharpe and Janet Munro and a whole string of cast members ( Sean Connery may have been but not sure ) I still have the souvenir programme, which by todays standards is a hoot to read. There was a huge guest list. The theatre was packed even though it held over 3500. Prior to Walt Disney making a short speech and the cast parading across the stage. The lights went down and the huge Compton organ rose hydraulically from the orchestra pit, with Tommy Dando the star organist playing some rousing tunes. Then the screen was lowered. I loved every minute of this film. Its on a par with The Quiet Man including the harsh fact that it doesn't reflect the Ireland of then or now - but frankly I don't give a damn. I've enjoyed a wide range of cinema all my life and yet every few years Darby O'Gill gets an airing and I feel better for it and considering I was only fifteen in 1959 that makes me feel even better!

I have been doing Tracy's Mat Workout for 6 weeks(5 times a week). This video works. I have seen definite results. My hips and thighs are much more balanced, my arms are more defined and my core feels much stronger. The most unexpected thing though is a definite decrease in the cellulite on my thighs and tush.

My wife and I use this all the time, since we have different tastes in coffee. And for guests who drink decaf, it's perfect to brew them one cup, instead of brewing a whole pot just for them.
The only drawback is that the coffee cups you have to use with this product are very expensive. If you're a heavy coffee drinker like me, plan on spending more then twice the amount you would brewing pots.

Kudos to who knows who said that. This is an excellent show and great entertainment, and I don't have an issue with the pricing. With values such as Amazon I can watch the show and still munch on popcorn at the same time. At some point you have to decide if the cost exceeds your desire to see the show. For me it hasn't. For those who complain, but still buy the DVD sets, it hasn't either. At some point, however, I'll stop putting gas in my car. That's another story and probably a truer example of one of the many ways we are truly being ripped off, but at least with BSG there is a great idea, with talented writers and Im getting great entertainment and I'm happy.

I make one to two frozen fruit/protein smoothies a day and this blender has not failed me yet. The moveable parts are made of metal and are very durable. I usually have to buy a blender every six months because the plastic parts on the blender crack and break. Also, the price for this blender is very affordable. 5 stars!

Are you looking for an alternative to microwave popcorn? Then this hot air popper will give a better popping option than the high fat, high sodium contained in microwave popcorn bags.
  I've always utilized the proven stovetop method for popping my kernels. How much oil in the bottom? How much kernels to I put in? How long do I wait before I take it off the flame? I have got this method down to a science with no unpopped kernels or burned popcorn through experimenting. It was a lot of trial and error that got me to that point. But I wanted another option to cleaning the oily pan and cover.  And the added benefit of less oil on my popcorn since I need to watch what I ingest now in my older years.
The Orville Hot Air Corm Popper was the choice I made over the other brands that utilized hot air and automatic stir methods. A few friends had these brands and did not like restricted user operator options. The plastic cover on this model is made of high intensity, heat resistant Polycarbonate that will get hot but not melt with consistent usage.  Please read the instructions, how to use and safeguards before operating this unit because this appliance contains a high intense heat element.
  I never put more than the recommended � cup kernels in the hot air chamber. The � cup is located on top of the unit which also melts room temperature butter while popping. Put the kernels in the popping chamber and then plug in the unit. (There is no on/off switch so don't leave this unit unattended.) The kernels will start taking the intense heat generated and will start to pop in about a minute. At this point a few kernels might fly out the shoot because of the forced hot air, but if a 4 quart bowl is used under the chute they will land in there. The popcorn will start to fill up the chamber and spill over into the bowl at rapid pace. It will help if the bowl is turned a few times so one side does not fill up. Once all of the popcorn comes out there will be about 5-10 kernels left still rotating in the hot air. At this point unplug the unit and let it cool. If the unit is left on to try to get all of the kernels popped they will start firing out the chute like hot  BB projectiles. 
  The popcorn can know be enjoyed with any toppings of choice. I like that I can control what I put on my popcorn. I do like real butter with a little popcorn salt and freshly grated Parmesan or store bought popcorn flavorings. I melt my refrigerated butter in the microwave for about 20 seconds. I once tried to put the flavorings on during popping, but only got them blown all over the floor, lesson learned once again. 
I would recommend this popper to everyone who wants a fast method of popping corn who wants to control what they have on their fresh, homemade, delicious popcorn.

I have to admit that I was hesistant at first to go see this - I thought it would likely be silly &amp; shallow &amp; leave my brain aching for substance, and I wasn't keen on seeing a movie based on toys my little brother used to play with. But, man was I wrong!! This movie is awesome! It is very cool, the special effects are out of this world, the acting is superb, the drama kept me rapt, and the best parts were that this movie was funny, moving and has a huge heart. For the modern audience who has seen a lot, this movie delivers. There are very few DVDs I will actually buy, but this is definitely one of them - the order is already in with Santa! Seriously, this movie is so touching, funny, ultra-cool and edge of your seat action-packed, we all left with huge smiles on our faces. I love you Bumblebee &amp; Optimus Prime!! You guys can come park in my garage any day!!

First off I would just like to say to the true fans of the Twilight Saga this is a amazing novel which is every bit as powerful as the previous three. To those who have been bashing it non-stop since its release quit trying to call yourselves fans and find another series to dump on.
This novel is my favorite in the series and everything tied together so nicely. To those having a problem with Jacob imprinting on Bella's daughter get your minds out of the gutter and quit jumping to horrible and nasty conclusions. If you were true fans you would have noticed that Quil also imprinted on a child and that their relationship is nothing sexual. It eventually would turn to that when the child reaches the age of the werewolf. I mean come on Jacob is just like a big brother to "Nessie" and there is nothing wrong with having a big brother.
To all those who have said that Bella and Edwards romance is not such a big part in this book it is. I mean the story does center around them. The story could not be completely all lovey dovey the entire time just because they got what they wanted. Stephenie Meyer was trying to make the relationship as real as possible. They have problems they have to worry about.
Then there is the Bella's daughter thing that everyone keeps freaking out about. Its was a nice inclusion into the story line and after the Character became more dominate I warmed up to her very well. Everyone on all the message boards are going on and on about how vampire's cannot have children and all that bull, but come on it is a fiction novel. Plus when it was stated that "Vampires could never have children" the key word being vampires it never said anything about a Vampire and a Human. This makes perfect sense since Bella and Edward are one of a kind. They have a relationship it is a loving relationship not a predator and prey thing.
So all in all this was a excellent way to end the series.  The story flowed well together and gave new insight into certain characters. For all those Jacob haters out there (I was one of them) the section of the book that is narrated by him gives new insight to his character and made me beging to like Jacob for the first time since the series began.
Stephenie Meyer did a excellent job finishing her beautiful series and offering two unforgettable lovers that I think will go down in history as two famous fictional lovers. To those hating this book, make up your own ending and quit putting down the author...I don't see any of you writing bestselling novels. 
I would recommend this book to any and evryone who enjoys a good story that  is powerful and emotional. It is a perfct way to end a beloved series. READ THIS BOOK!!! Quit listening to all the haters who went in reading the book just trying to find its flaws.

Many of the recent SciFi shows fall into two categories: stupid (Voyager, Enterprise, Andromeda) or boring (Stargate SG-1, Stargate Atlantis, Firefly).
It took Ron Moore (a veteran of the greatest SciFi show of all times - Deep Space Nine) to rejuvenate an entire genre.
The new Battlestar Galactica is the exact opposite of the old one - it's adult, gritty, dark and sophisticated.
It's an intelligent show for intelligent people.
With so much garbage on TV today it surprised a lot of people that the best TV show right now comes from a genre that is looked down upon by so many.
The ratings are fantastic and the show will be on for a long time - so if you haven't watched it on TV then buy this DVD set.
Otherwise you'll be missing the greatest thing on TV right now.

If you're reading this review I assume you're looking for a game controller, perhaps one similar in feel to the PS and PS2 controllers and that you want the analog stick (though for other creative uses, see some of the other reviews people have written).  I didn't specifically buy this controller because it was wireless (though I appreciated this future much after I got it), for me it was between this one and a few other similar Logitech models that didn't offer wireless or rumble support (to be honest I never used the rumble support anyway).  My friends had another Logitech controller (I believe the Logitech Dual Action Gamepad) which I thought was fine, but I read on Amazon and heard from others that the control stick broke to easily, so I decided to shell out a few extra bucks for this one, and I've been happy.  It's great for emulators.
It's noticeably heavier than it's wired and non-rumble counterparts, but it's never uncomfortable to use, and the wirelessness is really nice, especially when playing a four player game on a computer when you want people to be able to walk by easily or not get the cords all tangled.  I've never had any problems with this, never needed to install it on any computer, and never had any problems with it being recognized by the USB unit, which always detects it just fine.  And the battery life seems great (I've been using it quite a bit, and haven't had to replace the batteries yet, which were thankfully included).  It's also very portable (even though it has two parts to it) and very comfortable to use.
Note to Mac users: The Amazon page says it's OS X compatible, but the actual product said no such thing on it, but it worked for me, so I suppose it really is OS X compatible and Amazon is correct.  More specifically, I primarily use this on my friend's pc when we play games, but I tried it on my MacBook (it's an Intel Mac) running OS X and although the operating system didn't seem to detect it, the controller worked just fine with applications that recognized it, such as certain emulators.

I've had this camera for over a month. The video quality is excellent, sharp with great color. Excellent portability, almost dissapears in your hand. This is truly a take everywhere camera. You will alway have it with you so you won't miss those great video oportunities. 
Likes
*Starts up fast. 
*Video sharp with great color. You will love the color
*Audio is great but if you take it to a concert turn down the gain it is very sensitive.
*small, easy to carry
*MJPEG can be edited in most computers
Some notes:
If you want to see what this camera can do, go to the vimeo website and search for TX1. I use Vegas Movie Studio to edit with no problem. The gorrila pod suggested is not great for video because the camera will wobble with any wind or bump. A walking stick type monopod is excellent though. Just an incredibly fun camera!

I love the SwaddleMe swaddlers. My newborn daughter slept so much better through the night when we swaddled her snugly. This product kept the swaddle secure with velcro closures. Also, it was easy to do diaper changes because you could keep baby's arms swaddled while you pull down the bottom part. 
We used the cotton knit during warm summer nights and the plush, microfleece swaddler for cooler nights to keep our little darling snug and warm.

Windows Live is fast and easy to upload. I would say it is very comparable with other virus scan products. My laptop is running faster and Windows Live has found viruses I wouldn't have thought possible. And since I have Windows Vista, this product is perfect!
On a side note, the packaging is very hard to open. I had to use a lot of force to open the plastic box. Perhaps in the future, Windows should make the packaging easier to open. 
As for the price, well, for a one time deal it is great but beware of the continue license to use and other secret money making options.

For all those who criticize this product by comparing it to a Windows Laptop, I am sorry by you are wrong.
This is an Ultra Mobile Personal Computer.  If you want a computer for on-the-go, to use Skype for WiFi calls, a real Browser (Firefox), and the ability read/edit/send all Office documents, this is it.
Yes, the keyboard is cramped, yes, the screen is small.  It weighs 2lbs, and for the price it is a 5-star winner.  If the price were $700, this device deserves to be heavily criticized.  It is $299.

In the interest of helping out other cat lovers, I am posting this review. I threw away three perfectly operational LitterMaid automatic cat boxes when I saw how well this worked, and then I ordered a second one of these.
It works just like they say, and if you use FLUSHABLE litter, not only do you spare yourself the nastiness of having to bend over and chisel cat poop off the appliance/litter box (due to the great engineering of this catbox), you don't have to carry a ninety pound back of you know what out to the trash, making the trash collectors hate you when the bag breaks (because you carried the slide out drawer with huge handle to the toilet and flushed it).
It now takes 30 seconds to clean my cat box, and is 98% less disgusting. We no longer fight about whose turn it is, because I don't mind doing it.
Added bonus: unlike the Littermaid, you never, ever have to buy accessories for it.

After about a month or so of using it as directed on the bottle, we started to notice a real difference in tear staining.  No more crusty build-up around the eyes.  It doesn't prevent the tearing completely, but there's no longer any red/brown colored stain.  Any tearing dries up clear.  We had no digestion problems or refusal to eat it.  We found it easiest to mix the Angel Eyes powder with some wet food so that everything gets consumed.  Overall very satisfied.

My dad's cardiologist recommended getting a blood pressure monitor for the house to check his pressure regularly.  He suggested the arm-cuff type was better (lower variance in the readings) than the wrist-cuff version.  So, we got the Omron HEM-780.  It's a little marvel:  It's very easy to use, it's fast, and it's so compact that it fits in the medicine cabinet.  At least a couple of times my dad's blood pressure hiked up unexpectedly and this little monitor took the guesswork out of both occasions -- he adjusted his meds as per his doctor's instructions -- without need for emergency care.  I would very highly recommend it.

This review is from: Wall-E (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)
      
My favorite Disney Pixar movie of all time is Toy Story and now I can say that it is WALL*E. If you enjoy the Pixar movies, you will love this movie. Even if you aren't a fan of animation, I whole heartily recommend you go see WALL*E. As an adult I was taught a lesson. When a child and adult can leave a movie together and talk about the same things they watched and ask questions, that is really an amazing thing.
Synopsis: What if mankind had to leave Earth, and somebody forgot to turn the last robot off? After hundreds of lonely years of doing what he was built for, WALL*E (short for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) discovers a new purpose in life (besides collecting knick-knacks) when he meets a sleek search robot named EVE. EVE comes to realize that WALL*E has inadvertently stumbled upon the key to the planet's future, and races back to space to report her findings to the humans (who have been eagerly awaiting word that it is safe to return home). Meanwhile, WALL*E chases EVE across the galaxy and sets an adventure into motion. Joining WALL*E on his journey across the universe is a cast of characters including a pet cockroach and a heroic team of malfunctioning misfit robots.
The first few minutes of WALL*E are a bit depressing. Earth is a vast wasteland of garbage. And when I say wasteland, I mean that in the literal sense. Humans have left Earth because of the output of garbage, waste and abuse to the environment. The year is 2775 and all that remains are skyscrapers, filth and waste. As I sat there, the six year turns to me and asks what has happened to the Earth? Why all the garbage? I honestly have no answer for him and as he turns back to look at the screen he says, garbage is very bad. Things become a bit lighter as we see WALL*E on the screen. The character of WALL*E is so very much like a child. He sees things as a child would. Even though his job is to clean up the garbage the best he can, he likes to collect things such as Rubik Cubes, light bulbs and utensils. WALL*E has such an incredible personality that shows he is not just a mindless robot. He enjoys watching an old time 1950's musical and loves the music and the dancing. He especially enjoys watching one scene over and over again where a man and woman are holding hands and sing to each other. WALL*E assumes love means holding hands; but he has no one to hold hands with.
EVE comes down to Earth with a directive in mind. She reminded me of a mutant egg, but quickly just as WALL*E tugged at my heart, EVE will do the same with you. WALL*E welcomes her with open arms, so very happy he has another to share his toys with. He assumes she will want to stay with him and perhaps she will be the one to finally hold his hand. (The hand holding becomes very important throughout the movie) But WALL*E has in his possession what EVE is searching for. WALL*E has found a small plant growing out of all the waste and gives it to EVE. By plant life beginning to grown on Earth again after hundreds of years, that means humans can return to their home and begin a new.
EVE is taken back to her ship and WALL*E follows her because he thinks she is in danger. EVE is sent back to a huge giant like cruise spaceship where humans live as if they are on permanent vacation. Another disturbing fact is that because robots do everything for humans, humans have become big lazy blobs who ride around in chairs as they drink fatting shakes and watching TV very oblivious to life around them. When the Captain of the ship receives the plant, it means they can return home to Earth. But his co-pilot, which is a robot and so very much like HAL from the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey has specific instructions that humans can not return to Earth. It takes over the ship's controls and tries to stop WALL*E and EVE from placing the plant in a certain part of the ship that will enable them to go back to Earth.
So many lessons were taught and learned in this simple animated movie. It is heartbreaking to think in hundreds of years, Earth may no longer be inhabitable by living things and we would have to leave to travel in space with no meaning. WALL*E in some ways is very much like 2001: A Space Odyssey and as an adult I laughed at so many hidden jokes that came straight from the movie. But like 2001, there is hope and in WALL*E even though things look hopeless, that is not the case. Even though Earth is devastated, things can change. By the end of WALL*E my depression that I felt at the beginning of the movie became a feeling of hope. You must stay till the very end and watch the closing credits because as Peter Gabriel sings, we see through very amateur drawings how humans can make Earth so very green again because of a robot who should have no feelings or personality was able to deliver one small plant that will become the roots for a future of hope.

This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)
      
I had originally heard about the series from some of my friends- several of which were reading it- so I took it out from the library and was instantly hooked. I bought the second and third (New Moon and Eclipse) so I wouldn't have to wait for them to come through the library. I even pre-ordered the fourth (Host, scheduled to come out in May) before I had started the second. 
Even though I'm not a huge fan of most science fiction or fantasy, I really liked the vampire spin on reality. It made it believable as opposed to just some stupid book about vampires and other nonsense. The vampire, Edward, is so incredibly alluring and intriguing that you are pulled in and just want to learn more and more about him like and insatiable hunger. Then there's Bella, someone you instantly fall in love with.
I highly recommend this book for everyone. Even if you don't normally like science fiction, you'll be surprised- it's very believable.

The 80's were particularly bad for Disney. After sailing to the massive heights of Cinderella, Bambi, Snow White and Sleeping Beauty, Disney was now making films such as Black Cauldron, Oliver &amp; Company and Great Mouse Detective which didn't do the greatest of business. So Little Mermaid comes out and while box-office wise not as massive as Lion King or Aladdin, put the company back on track again. I wouldn't call it Disney's best but it's certainly highly enjoyable, surprisingly affecting and a better movie than you'd think.
Taking place in the ocean's depths, Ariel is a 16 year old mermaid who's fascinated by the surface world. Her father, King Triton, forbids any contact and is especially mad when Ariel falls for a prince named Eric. Wanting to be with him, Ariel strikes a deal with sea witch Ursula: get Eric to give her true love kiss and she'll remain a human forever, or she'll belong to Ursula. With the help of friends Sebastian, Flounder and Scuttle, Ariel has to break the spell in 3 days.
What's incredibly surprising about Little Mermaid is that there's very little pacing problems. Unlike let's say, Hercules or Hunchback of Notre Dame which, while good, had a couple slow parts, there's rarely a scene that just feels long. If it's not the story that's catching you, it's a catchy song and the movie's full of them. To the emotional Part of Your World to the renowned Under the Sea the film has uplifting music that even you'll get in your head. And when you have frogs singing verses on Kiss the Girl, that's charming and a great song.
One thing that surprised me about the transfer was while brighter than the old releases, it didn't have that lush colorful feel like Lion King or Beauty and the Beast. Does the film have any problems? Um, well couple of the animation scenes are spotty, including backgrounds that look too painted and shifting character designs. One minute, Ariel is beautiful and stunning than she'll have this weird look to her where she looks off-kilter to other scenes. And even though he redeems himself, King Triton is arguably the worst father I've seen in a Disney film, instead of being overprotective, he comes across as almost militant-like.
Since this is going back into the dreaded "Vault" I'd suggest getting this quick. It's a great film, not only for kids but just for casual viewing. By the way, I believe the next ones are either Peter Pan, 101 Dalmations and Jungle Book.

I languished over the reviews of the currently available Mini's and after reading all I could find the playing field was pretty much the same. Atom 1.6 processor except HP but they were ruled out early for price bloat. I won't spend $700.00+ for a UMPC, to me that defeats the purpose. To me a Ultra Portable is used as a supplement to a full fledged Laptop not to replace it. So after studying the contestants I made my criteria for selection. The O.S. had to be Windows XP for its combination of low system demands and its compatibility with everyday programs such as Word. Next I decided that it needed a traditional hard drive not the more expensive low capacity flash derivatives that aren't discernibly faster. Third was battery life and last but seemingly more important was the aesthetics. I wanted it to look cool because I knew it would draw attention amongst my co-workers. 
I came down to the MSI Wind and the Acer One. I am a big fan of the glossy screen technology and of a exterior that has the bling appeal. The MSI has the Matte screen and a Matte exterior, boring!
So the Acer Won or should I say One. But only in the 160 gig 6 cell battery version. It's not that anyone would need the 160 gig drive but that is how the Win.XP, 6 cell battery version comes packaged which is ok by me. 
The bling is spot on! The exterior is a deep Metallic Blue...and is just outstanding to look at. Yeah you'll leave finger prints like all the reviewers noted but guess what I just used a old, (but clean) sock and Wala!! wiped them off in ohh maybe 5 seconds!! Christ these reviewers are wimpy. It boots into XP faster than any desktop I've owned, repaired or built, &lt; than 30 seconds. The six cell battery sticks out from the rear of the case but does not make it look odd and the extended battery life is worth it! Five hours on a charge, thats unheard of with traditional Laptops. It acquires my wireless access very quickly and surfs with all the speed my router pushes out. I didn't bother getting an external C/D drive to install any programs that I had on C/D. I just plugged in my 4 gig USB drive into my desktop machine and copied the installation C/D I needed onto it. Then plugged the USB thumb drive into my Acer One and double clicked the installation .exe and away it went. It also has a built in web cam wich is pretty cool. Works fine but of course it's not your 30 frame a second hand held, but its fine for getting freaky with your g/f if shes off on a business trip.
Probably the best function with this is to get a Wireless plan through your cell provider so you can connect anywhere your phone has service but there plans are so dam expensive!
I really like this Mini, it's well worth the $399 price tag. Thats what Amazon sells them for when they have them in stock, crazy sweet deal. Don't pay the extra $100 that places like Tiger have jacked it up to, just wait Amazon will get more. Newegg will treat you right as well.
If your in the market for a mini, the Acer Aspire One will not disappoint!! Remember the Blue is just Killer.

This mouse is not perfect but I would have given it a 4.5 so I upgraded it to a 5.
For my large hands this mouse feels just right. It moves well on my nylon mat that I use for a pad and I have tried it on a hardwood desktop with good results. The mouse has very good yaw and pitch movement and it is easy to adjust dpi setting on the fly.
It has a quick turn feature that works very well in first person shooters. you assign one of the buttons for quick turn around and as your playing if you want to check who's behind you click the button and you turn 180 degree's. If you need to change your direction fast because you can see your out numbered ahead it comes in mighty handy.
The top buttons have a good responsive click to them and I had no problem with learning the over and under side buttons, which I perfer over my old Logitec MX518 foward and aft configuration.
The weight of this mouse without adding extra weights feels about the same as the MX518. I choose to add 5 grams of weight to it and perfer it that way.
The mouse wheel has a micro feeling touch and a little too light for my taste, but I got use to it fairly quickly. The one feature I think would have made this a great mouse would to have put side push switching on the wheel for adjusting look around corners.
I think this mouse is well constructed and will hold up for a long while.
If you running windows/vista than it has two other buttons that bring up the game file and macro changing, useful but not really must have feature.
All in all a confident and very good gaming mouse.

If you want a do-it-all package that is very portable, then get this machine. It is a must.
I bought this machine because I needed a new laptop and wanted something that was very portable. I opted for the 10" screen and the 6 cell battery because of recommendations from other reviews. I am not regretting the choices.
This thing is fabulous! It does everything they claim and more. The size does not get in the way, and the keyboard is hardly smaller than normal so it is very easy to use. The screen is big enough, but I must confess when I go back to my 15" Dell, I hear the theme from 2001 A Space Odyssey in my head. ;)
Speed in booting is very good. Conectivity is very good too. It can automatically connect to any wifi it has been connected to in the past as it is in range. In other words, it can and does hand off to the strongest signal it can find as you move. A handy feature when you are a passenger in a car and there are lots of hotspots along the way. I bought an external antenna for use with my larger laptop and it worked well, however this mini-laptop has better ability to bring in the signals. Case in point: I am using a wifi signal that the other machine - external antenna and all - cannot even detect.
As for the lack of bluetooth I use the USB device I have had for some time so no loss there over the other model. If I ever find I need wirelss N, I can get the external USB card too - so no worries.
I thought I would miss a drive on this thing but so far I don't - surprisingly. Anything I need I transfer with an USB drive or download from the 'net and all is fine. (With the exception of not being able to play movies well, so far... I just need to find better playback software.)
It works well with Skype and can multitask well. It is a good all-round portable machine.
The SD card adapter is more convenient than I ever thought it would be. The USB ports are fast and handy as heck. I no longer have to bring a hub with me. It is virtually an all inclusive machine for me, just what I wanted, it has enough built-ins and ports to do everything I need on the go without lugging a rat's nest of add-ons.
Now for the negatives;(I have to nit-pick to find any) I find it stutters a bit playing back movies recorded in AVI format. I suppose it must be the player software as my older, much slower machine plays them effortlessly. I'll post a comment if I find out what works for them. I watch Netflix movies on it daily, and that works beautifully! The idea is that I like to take DVD movies with me sometimes and without an internal DVD drive, I need to record them in digital memory to play them back on this machine. I have to find a good, smooth playing format, that won't eat-up the entire hard disk if I am going to do that. I simply hate jittery video. Also, the speakers are sometimes hard to hear with lower sound levels, but that is what headphones are for. Besides, what do you expect from tiny little speakers on a laptop? Well, these sound pretty good, just not all that loud sometimes (depending on source levels).
Also, the disk drive shows two partions at 80g and 60g that does not add up to 160 so I am wondering. Nothing to be alarmed about there is plenty of space. Also, the screen is a little short: as in it has less vertical space than I would like. Too many bars on the web browser and you need to scroll down just to see anything. A minor annoyance, but I suppose one must compromise somewhere. The case (in ebony) is a fingerprint magnet. I don't mind, I just clean it a lot then. Also, the buttons on the mouse pad are a lot stiffer than any others I have ever used, but one can get used to it. As usual for me, there are too many features on the mouse pad and the keyboard: one fumble and you've done something weird. I wish I could turn off a feature or two on that mouse pad, but that's just the way I look at things. I want it to do what I am telling it rather than what it thinks I want it to do.
Conclusion:
All in all I can't really fault the machine. I've been using it for about a month now, every day, and it has never disappointed me. I've never been able to say that before, in my 33 years of computer use. Hence the five stars.

<review id="311" label="1">
Having watched this movie on a plane ride, my first impression was that I really liked the movie. My second impression is that it would look nice in HD. Thankfully Marvel Studios and Paramount have delivered a great Blu Ray release w/ HD video.
So the way the movie itself goes is typical super hero movie type stuff. If you aren't a fan of comic book style suspension of disbelief, please move on. You won't like this movie anymore than you did the other super hero movies out there.
Tony Stark, the sort of spoiled, super intelligent and conceited owner of Stark Enterprises finds himself in an impossible situation. While traveling through Iraq to show off his great new weapons the Humvee he is in is attacked and he is captured. He awakens to find that one of his captors has installed an electro magnet in his chest to prevent mobile shrapnel from the explosion Tony was caught in from reaching his heart.
In captivity he's asked to build one of his top of the line missiles for his captors, a Jericho missile. Instead he builds a prototype Iron Man suit and escapes. The experience changes his life and has him attempt to change his company and the world from the destruction he and has company have profited from.
Action, betrayal, small amount of clumsy love and that is Iron Man in a nut shell.
The video is presented via the AVC codec and looks amazing. The only areas of "problem" would be in the cave scenes. You can tell when the film stock changes or perhaps, if it was filmed in digital, grain was added to the video. The areas most affected are darker scenes and scenes where there is interaction between the prototype Iron Man suit (done in CG) and his environment and the terrorists. It's either an artistic decision or a choice to make the CG interaction less perceptible. It doesn't take away from the scenes and it doesn't detract from the movie.
The audio is done in Dolby True-HD and sounds fantastic. Lows are low and highs are high. No clipping, no distortion and great separation of channels over all.
Having bought quite a few Blu Ray discs, I'm painfully aware of the lack of HD extras. Not so with Iron Man. This release has 2 discs in it, one for the main feature and a few extras (deleted scenes) and one for quite a few interesting and in depth documentaries. And yes, the documentaries are ALL in HD. This may be the first Blu Ray disc I've purchased with all HD extras.
Also included is a BD Live connection. I have not yet created an account and logged in to see what's available, but even if all you have access to is what's on the disc, the extras are amazing. Not sure about the BD Live extras.
So if you're looking for a super hero movie with some amazing video, amazing audio and amazing extras, look no further than Iron Man on Blu Ray.
FOR THOSE EXPERIENCING LONG LOAD TIMES:
If you have a BD Live capable player, in the menus of your player, turn off "auto download" and set it to confirm (or something along those lines). The reason the movie takes "forever" to start when you first insert it is because the quiz portion from BD-Live needs to be downloaded and installed on your player. Just turn off auto install/connect and you should be good to go.
And once it is installed the first time, assuming you wait, you won't see it again unless you get a new player and want to watch the movie.

Ice cream maker was bought as an X-Mas gift and was probably the best one to give.  It is not too expensive and has been used numerous times to create delicious ice creams.

I would recommend looking up other ice cream recipes online to make healthier alternatives because the accompanying booklet calls for whole milk and cream mostly...

I bought this the other day along with a D-Link DSL-2320B modem.  The router works beautifully.  Easy to set up and very good signal strength.  The D-Link modem didn't work out and D-Link Tech Support wasn't very good at resolving the issue so I had to take that back.  I connected another modem to the router though and it works great.  I haven't bought a media streamer yet so don't know how that will work but suspect it will do just fine based on what I've seen the DIR-655 do so far.

For years friends have been urging me to get rid of the old-fashioned on the stove kettles and get a kettle that can be plugged in. I contemplated those japanese kinds with the plastic push pumps. After seeing this Breville at a friend's house I had to try it although the price point was more than I wanted to spend at the time. For this product, you get what you are paying for!
All the reviewers here were so helpful in making my decision. The best features of this product:
-  water heats up extremely fast
-  ergonomic designed handles with comfortable rubber and easy-to-pull plug (with a hole in the middle so you don't have to yank it out of the wall, genius)
-  functional design. when you turn on the kettle a pretty blue light comes on to indicate the power is on. when the water reaches temperature a bell dings to alert you. the stainless steel looks great on the counter and we use it now during the winter no less than 6 times a day. It's perfect.
Other thoughts:
-  metal was very important to us, didn't want any questionable plastic flavors in our tea or water
-  I also ready some reviews which complained the outside of the kettle got too hot. Guess what? Use some common sense it's a hot water kettle, don't touch the outside of at any point and you'll be fine.

I have an immune disorder that causes problems with periodontal disease. My dentist recommended that I purchase the Sonicare Toothbrush with the UV sanitizer. I had an older version of the Sonicare Toothbrush years ago, and this new version is vastly superior. I love the slimmer profile and the UV sanitizer. The new brushing modes make it virtually impossible to brush your teeth wrong. I love the way my mouth and teeth feel after using this toothbrush. It truly is "a just from the dentist clean". If this continues to perform the way it has so far I will be very happy. It is a little costly on the price, but definitely cheaper than major dental work. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that wants a whiter smile and healthier teeth.

I purchased this gate because it was wide enough to fit at the bottom of our stairs with the two extensions.

I ended up having to cut the bottom of both extensions for it to work properly.
Thankfully I did not buy the gate for the auto close feature, because it needs to be perfectly aligned for that feature to work completely.

I have the Magic Bullet and I read some less than good reviews on the unit. I would like to put those to rest if I may. 
1. After using the magic bullet, could smell the motor burning up.
   Having worked with motors in the past, I can put that bad rap to rest. There are two types of electrical motors commonly used in the market today. One is an induction motor. and the other is the brush and commentator motor. Although the induction motor is most commonly used, there are some brush types out there. The burning electrical smell you sensed is common, especially when first using the motor. When first used, the brushes are not worn slightly to perfectly fit against the commentator. Until that happens, the brushes will slightly arc and you will sense an electrical smell but it doesn't take long till they are perfectly fitted to the commentator. After that, the smell will no longer be there. This is normal and is not a problem. It is not a sign of overheating or any damage to the motor.   
2. I found an excellent quick way to clean the Bullet. I first spray the blade and inside of the cup to remove larger particles, then I fill the cup about 1/3 full with water and just a drop of soap detergent. Screw the blade lid on firmly and pulse it a few times. Unscrew and rinse and you will have a sparkling clean unit. This will get into areas that otherwise you couldn't possibly reach especially in and around the blade area.  
3. I have also found that removing the processed food from the cup is best done with a small rubber spatula as use of a metal object like a knife or fork etc will eventually scratch and mar the plastic. 
4. My Magic Bullet came with several replacement rubber gaskets that are used inside the black blade screw on caps. When you have cleaned your unit and you are going to store with blade cap screwed onto the food cup, do not screw the blade cap tightly with the food cup as when it is stored even overnite, the rubber gasket will tend to flatten out and then need replacement.
I always leave mine about a turn loose and you will get a lot more use out the gaskets.
5. When I am making a sandwich spread or anything requiring mayo I wait until I have finished processing the food and then I mix the processed food and mayo in a separate bowl. If you add the mayo before processing, the mayo and the fool is going to stick to the sides and even tapping is not going to loosen it. 
6. The instruction book says that you need to occasionally tap the blade/cup unit to free up food to get to the blade. I have personally found that a back and forth shaking motion does a much better job as all the food in usually at the bottom anyway and a few shakes will move it into the blades and wa-la, it works mucho bettro. 
7. If you read the instructions and use accordingly, you will find the magic bullet works, (Maybe not excatly like on TV) but I am very pleased with mine. I have also fould that the shorter   pulses seem to work best as they don't tend to sling the food out and away from the blade. 
8. I tried processing some pecans, mixed a little soy milk and honey and created some great tasting health food.
If you are considering the Magic Bullet, I can just say that it is like anything else, when directions are followed, it will work fine. When I picked up the Base unit, the weight tells me that the motor is plenty big enough to get the job done. A light motor, light duty, a heavy motor, heavy  duty. Enjoy  
Thanks for your time,
Darryl K Springston

I just got this dreamsie for my 3 and half months old baby. He is 18 lbs and 26 inches. He's a big baby and I hope he doesn't outgrow this dreamsie in a month or two. I like that once I put him in it for the night, he seems to sleep so much better. He used to kick the blanket off him, then it got too cold for him and he would cry out for us. Now he's not able to do that no more. He's warm and in "deep sleep" with it. I like the fact that there is no way my baby can wiggle the dreamsie onto his face. I now have a better sleep myself too by knowing he won't be cold in the night no more. No more getting up in the middle of the night to check on him. I love the dreamsie!

I got the Panasonic SD-YD250 as a Christmas present, and have been very happy with it! I've read the other reviews on here about bread makers in general, and some people get a perfect loaf every time, and others don't have any luck at all. I think the trick is that you need to **weigh** the flour - 8 ounzes of flour is NOT a cup of flour! It must be weighed, so the ingredient list shows dry ounzes and wet ounzes which means it must be weighed. If you use a measuring cup for the flour - it will be the wrong amount and will not come out correctly! Another item it to be sure you use good "bread maker" flour, and room temperature water. The store even carries bread ingredients "in the box" where all you have to do is add the ingredients out of the box into the breadmaker and some water and it also turned out a perfect loaf! I used the "honey wheat berry" in the box, and it had a few too many large wheat seeds, but the bread turned out perfect. Use the "light" crust setting, since the crust can be a little too thick &amp; chewy if use the medium(which is good for italian bread though). My favorite recipe in the recipe book is the "egg bread", which uses real milk and 2 eggs(gives it a great flavor). The XL size of this unit makes a huge loaf and it rises so high that it almost touches the top of the unit! So I'm not sure what others meant by the bread not rising. I highly recommend this unit and you'll be making perfect hot fresh bread in no-time because it's so easy!

The machine works fine.
If you buy the firewire cable (e.g., Sony VMC-IL4615 1.5 Meter i.LINK 4-Pin to 6-Pin Digital Video Transfer Cable) you can actually download the movies to a computer (as another reviewer pointed out). On the mac it works well easily and basically flawlessly (sometimes the rewind hangs on you, but it might be the OS X I have on that machine).
Image quality is OK, I guess. You have to realize that I am  an obsessed still photographer, so I will always complain for the image quality of a CAM recorder. It needs care when shooting at maximal focal lenght because it is so small that it is easy to make "sea-sick" productions.
I previously ownen a JVC which I hated with all my heart. This one is great.
I would definitely buy it again. If I had more money, I would buy the more expensive version of the same camera.

I saved up my Pepsi points for this, and have never been so happy with a "loyalty program reward".  I got this to replace my old PNY 512MB drive.  I don't have a tonne of chunky files to carry around, but my portable FireFox profile and Thunderbird archive were filling the whole thing up with no room for much else.  I also had a few sectors go bad on the PNY, further limiting just how much storage was available to me.
Knowing that I now have the Kingston name and warranty leaves me feeling much more secure.  I don't personally know anyone who has ever complained about bad sectors on a Kingston USB drive.  Moving up to the 2GB drive, I have room for all of the portable applications I need with plenty of room to spare for files.  Carrying something the size of a keychain beats the pants off of lugging my laptop bag everywhere.  I've actually uninstalled the registered versions of Firefox and Thunderbird and now run only the portable versions natively on my desktops and laptop, which makes synch'ing everything via USB drive that much faster.  As to file transfer rate, the Kingston drive also seems to complete transfers much faster than my previous drive.
It's not nearly as big as some of the other options on the market now, but 2GB is plenty enough storage space for me when I'm away from home. I'm sure it's plenty enough for other folks too.  For the available storage -- it's great!

Works exactly as promised. Just plug it into the USB port and it will do the rest for you! It saves common files, which includes pretty much anything you use on a regular basis unless you are doing very specialized work. Documents, spreadsheets, email files, photos, videos, you name it. It also saves files according to which computer they came from, so if you back up more than one computer in one device, it will keep everything organized. I used to be a slacker about doing backups, but with this it just takes two seconds on your part and the device does the rest! I also like that the backup process can run very smoothly in the background while you keep using the computer, without making the computer sluggish.

I've used the ClickFree on 2 computers and it keeps track of what information is from each computer, separates it.  It downloads the entire computer in about 20 minutes if you have high speed.  On my new computer of about 6 months, it only took about 4 minutes to download everything I had on it.  This item is great.  I can now transfer all my information from one computer to another one in a flash.  Just click and do nothing more, just wait and it does everything for you.  It even updates from the last thing you downloaded, continues from where you left off and downloads only the new info.  Fantastic

As an Adams buff, I was highly skeptical this movie would be acceptable to my fellow Adams historians.  We would not now have a country without John Adams.  In spite of his mistakes (the Aliens and Seditions Act being the worst), he was an honest, ethical person whose contributions have been overshadowed by better politicians like Jefferson and Franklin. He was generations ahead of his time in his social perspectives (his staunch abolitionism and respect for women being two of them). There is no John Adams monument in Washington, DC and no picture of Adams on our everyday currency (despite non-Presidents images appearing) but at least we have McCullough's wondrous book and now this beautiful film.  Abigail Adams, no less a person than John Adams, was her husband's best friend and chief adviser.  They were equals at a time when there was little power for, as Abigail said, "women and slaves".
The film completely recreates the time.  Anyone who has been to Adams' birthplace and Peacefield can attest to how accurate the depictions are of those places.  Giamatti's intelligent, intuitive performance has made  the role his.  Linney, Dillane, Morse and Wilkinson are also excellent.  The direction is adult, unflinching and honest.  And yes, it is shot a bit dark but the content more than makes up for the camera.  I can't recommend it highly enough.  The sacrifices of this good and decent human being will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.

This review is from: Transformers (DVD)
      
I grew up watching the old Transformers cartoons and playing with the Transformer toys so I was interested in seeing how they were going to do this live action film.
I watched the DVD and I have to say that it was better than I expected.  The special effects of course were brilliant and the plotline even made sense.  The acting is also pretty good.
Other than the film, there isn't much on the DVD itself, atleast not in the standard version.

I thought this was a great ending to a great series!!  Yes, it was a perfect ending and Bella got everything she wanted, a little unrealistic, yes...but it's FICTION!!  I don't know about the rest of the population, but I read fiction to escape reality and not dwell on life's problems.  It never ends happily every after in real life so it's nice to see a happy ending for the characters I've grown to love in this series.
I also loved 'The Host' and am now forever a Meyer fan!

I saw the videos online and decided to purchase the Furminator. However, I was expecting just another "gadget." I'm happy to report that I was wrong. The Furminator arrived last night and I immediately put it to work on my cat who has a very dense undercoat. He seemed to enjoy it and even turned over so I could get his belly. After about five minutes, I had enough fur to construct two more cats! This thing works as advertised. If you have pets that shed ... buy this. You won't be disappointed.

I should provide a disclaimer:  I'm a Windows convert, though I used Macs intermittently over the past 14 years; I wasn't paying attention to how cool they'd gotten until the new Macbooks came out and I realized that OS X existed.  Therefore, this review doesn't compare the new MBP with the more recent older Mac machines.  I'm mostly just comparing my new MBP to the long string of Windows machines I've owned, the most recent one being a beefy version of the Dell Latitude D610 laptop. 
That said, it's been a month since I received my new MBP from Amazon, and I absolutely love it.
Keyboard:  very comfortable and quiet; limited space to get crumbs stuck beneath the keys.  Very good size.
Trackpad:  Generous space and smooth operation for the most part; the only shadow in my glowing review is that as others have mentioned, the trackpad can be really buggy sometimes.  It was definitely worse right out of the box, so don't let that scare you if it happens - it gets better with use.  A month later, I almost prefer using the trackpad to a regular mouse because of its multitouch functions that make scrolling and navigating such a breeze, and I love the smooth feel of the pad itself, but it won't always register a double click on an item if I, say, want to pick up a file and drag it somewhere.  Sometimes even physically clicking the pad won't register appropriately.  I have the bottom right corner designated as "right-click," but sometimes areas other than that one will register as right-clicks, too.  This doesn't happen all the time, but it's still kind of irritating that it happens at all.  Even given that, though, I love this trackpad and wouldn't trade it for any PC trackpad.
Chassis:  so, so solid, yet so lightweight, thin and beautiful.  You can feel this for yourself if you go play with one at an Apple store.  I'll be heeding others' comments here about how thin the metal is around some of the ports, though.
Screen:  lots of people hate it.  I don't!  I work with my computer in a variety of different light settings around my home and I took it to my office once, but I have not used it outside yet (but come springtime, you can bet I will).  Yes, sometimes there is glare, but guess what?  I can tilt the screen or shift the computer a little to one side to avoid most of it.  I think the quality and beauty of the screen is more than worth these tiny adjustments I have to make to compensate for its reflectiveness.  Some people definitely prefer matte screens, but if you like the look of the glossy screen or want the color quality that comes with it, don't fear the glare, unless you're super picky about the kinds of adjustments I described.  (One note, though it's already been said:  the regular MB does not have as nice a screen; comparing the two myself in an Apple store, I could definitely see a difference in color quality and viewing angles.)
OS:  I really love the new Mac OS.  It's so seamless, so intuitive, and I love how all the programs work together.  It's not as if I need an OS this user-friendly, either; I was technically savvy enough to understand Windows pretty well, and I use Linux at work.  But it's just so nice to come home to an OS that knows what it's doing and does things for me.  Also, with Mac much more popular nowadays, my fears of finding software options closed to me have proven unfounded.  Granted, I'm not looking for any particularly necessary, high-end software for major projects; just little things like clients for various tasks, free art software (like the Gimp), and things like that.  I also found a program that lets me change the system fonts, since to be honest, the giant Lucida Grande was starting to grate on me just a little after a lifetime of being in total control of my GUI.
Performance:  I have not had a single crash yet.  I think something slowed things down once, and I restarted.  Once.  In a month.  And it was probably my fault.  The system is very fast; during my file transfers from the old computer to the new one, it takes my Dell (2.13 GHz) multiple minutes to copy files it takes my Mac (2.4 GHz) "about a minute" to copy.  Airport wireless worked easily the minute I took my computer out of the box, is really reliable and maintains a really strong connection.  My MBP runs super-quietly, it refuses to heat up (during our frigid Northern winters, this could actually be seen as a con!), DVDs run reasonably quietly, and, well, basically, everything just works, quietly, quickly, and easily.
I can't recommend getting a Mac enough, especially a MBP if you have the extra cash.  It's arguable whether I really did, but for better or worse, I'm glad I shelled out.  
I bought my Mac and AppleCare through Amazon and had no problems, avoided sales tax, and got a good cash-back rebate.

Customer review from the Amazon Vine&amp;#8482; Program (What's this?)
      
I had read mixed reviews about MS Office for the Mac and was reluctant to install it on my MacBook Pro.  As it turns out, my fears were unfounded.  It does have a different look than the Windows version and takes a little getting used to .  I am pleasantly surprised with the speed of the applications as I had read that it was a bit sluggish.  Not the case at all.  It is very zippy and the few docs and spreadsheets that I've experimented with have migrated back and forth between my Mac and PC with no problems, so far.    I'm not sure that it is worth buying, however, if you already have IWorks on your Mac, since you can export all of your files to a PC from the iWork applications.  In the end, I'll probably use the Office suite for my work applications and iWork for my personal use.

Being an advid baker, it was with trepidation that I purchased a machine to make bread.  This product came so highly rated by resources I put great faith in that I decided to try it.  
The end product is delicious.  It is so easy to make a loaf of warm, soft, and wonderful bread.
The only issue I have is that the loaves produce slices larger that our toaster.  
Also, it is smart to feel the dough during the 'add in' period to make certain that it is of the consistency for a proper rise.  
I have been using this machine at least two times per week since receiving it.  My family and I are really hooked.  I love my Zoey.

I am very impressed with the Linksys-Cisco WRT54GL Wireless-G Broadband Router. I am no networking guru, yet I was able to set this router up in a pretty straightforward manner, with almost none of the complications I expected. I used to enjoy experimenting with networks when I was younger, so its nice to know I have the options this router allows, but to tell you the truth, I'm so satisfied with what came in the box that I probably won't be changing it any time soon -- in fact I bought another for my parents, who were having a terrible time with the wireless router they rented from their ISP (They are very happy with this router as well.)
The signal is strong enough to pick up a hundred feet away, through at least one wall. The encryption package offers several options, including WPA 2. I have had one failure that occurred while I was setting the router up, all I had to do was unplug it for ten seconds to reset, and it has worked perfectly ever since. The directions are very good, clearly written and comprehensive (including security precautions.)
The last thing I love about this router is the additional options allowed by the ethernet ports on the back -- all the old computers (including an Apple IIe) came out of the garage and are now connected  to the internet, and to each other. This is a fabulous product right out of the box, I can't imagine what can be done with it by people who really know what they are doing. I am very satisfied with this purchase.

I have a 1 year old Shar Pei who HAD chronic yeast infections due to his small ear canals.  He would shake his head constantly.  I tried everything I could find, but I refused to go to the vet where they would prescribe some over-priced solution that would not treat the problem.  I started to search all over the internet for something that would work.  The famous home-remedy of boric acid seemed to work, but it took a lot longer to become effective.  I finally found ZYMOX and knew I had nothing to lose.  When it arrived my dog's ears were smelly, his ear canals were swollen and red, and he was contastaly shaking his head.  After one day (2 treatments/day) his behavior completely changed.  He was more comfortable for sure.  It took a few more days before the real results became noticable.  The amount of brown gooey material that was coming out of his ears was amazing!  ZYMOX was loosening up and allowing the mess to slowly make it's way out of his ears when he shook his head.  Honestly, it took about 14 days of repeat treatments (1 per day after the first week) to really get rid of the infection.  But, it worked!  and more importantly, I only have to treat his ears once every two weeks or so just to keep any infection from becoming a problem.  I have ordered two more bottle to keep on hand just in case.  My Shar Pei's ear canals are now a nice pale pink color, completely clean, not smelly, and he is finally happy.....  I wonder why Vet's don't recommend this product when you tell them you dog's problems?  They are quick to recommend expensive antibiotic solutions that don't treat YEAST INFECTIONS!  Thanks ZYMOX!

With three cats in my arsenal of cats this box works best for me. I have tried all kinds of boxes even the expensive motor driven kind. This works best. just roll and empty. One of my cats likes to pee on the inside wall of the box which killed the Littermaid, and hampered cleaning with the various other boxes I've owned. This box deals with it better because it is a MANUAL operated box. The cats cannot physically pee on the grate that seperates the clumps from the clean litter. Just roll it over daily and empty the container. Nothing is perfect, but this comes close. A bargain compared to the Littermaid and other "high-tech" boxes in terms of cost and maintenance.  Finally someone applied physics to a cat box. Give that person a raise!

I bought got the HV30 on Amazon about a week ago and the camera was exactly what I hoped for. When I first shot in HD I never thought it would turn out the way it did. Its INCREDIBLE.  I play xbox regulary in HD and have a lot of knowledge when it comes to picture quality and all I have to say is holy $#it. Amazing. Its easy to use and sexy looking, small sleek. The led light is cool too, nice and bright!. You dont need HD miniDV for high def, normal ones work. Be sure you have a firewire cable and a firewire port on your computer for the DV and HDV. Keep in mind there are certain programs that dont let you edit HD video, but the ones I am sure of are Sony Vegas and Pinnacle Studio. Be sure to check the system specification if you want to edit HD footage, you are gonna need a fairly buff computer.
The only downside if any, and im really prying here, would be that, unlike sony, there is no nightshot, nightvison that i could find. however, it does shoot awesome inn low light and have the 24p and 30p which are stunning. so i say BUY IT

I have been sim-racing for a while now with everything mounted to my computer desk. And my biggest peeve was the fact that it was a hassle removing everything when I was done racing, so I would leave everything on my desk and work around it. This wasn't very comfortable and I needed to find a solution. Well This Seat is really great it allows me to have everything setup and I can simply pull it away from the computer desk when I'm done racing.
The build on this is very impressive, its very sturdy steel and will handle just about any abusive driving situation that you will throw at it. It came with all the hardware needed to attach the G25 to the base plates which only adds to the sturdiness of the whole setup. I am 6'2 and was able to find a comfortable driving position with the amount of adjustments this seat allows.
My only problem was with the optional gear shift attachment as it doesn't have a vertical height adjustment feature and I find it sits a little low and will take some getting used to.
Overall this is a great addition to any sim racers setup and I highly recommend it!!

This is the second kettle I bought - I had to take the first one back because it rusted on the inside.  I bought this kettle after looking at what was available in the retail stores.  It felt more solid than the competitors.  I was hesitant in buying it because some online reviews indicated the inside of the kettle had a smell that would not go away.  There was a very slight smell at first (a new product smell) - but it disappeared after I rinsed it out.  It heats the water very quickly and shuts off automatically after the water has reached a boil - which is nice if you happen to be absentminded.  It is noisy when you first turn it on but quiets down when the water starts to boil.  I'm glad I spent the extra money and bought this brand. I'm very happy with it.

My home network was the first network that I had ever set up.  I have found the Netgear WGR614 802.11g Wireless Router to be a great unit.  The "G" standard means that it works much faster than the "B" standard for wireless applications.  I have two computers hard wired to this router, and use it's wireless capability for my third computer, a laptop.The only problems I had setting up the network had nothing to do with the router.  I have Norton Internet Security installed on my computers, and this caused communication problems until I figured out how to set up the firewalls to allow proper operation.Overall, I think this is an excellent router, and offers excellent performance for a reasonable expense.

I can't say enough about this mini-series. It was a five star on every level. It was totally entertaining and it always kept us pulled into the story. The acting was incredible and raw. Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney gave amazing performances. 
It was fascinating from a historical perspective. I learned so much, and I was so absolutely inspired by the story of John Adams and his family. This series showed the power of conviction John Adams had, but it also showed his imperfections of those of others. I also learned a lot about how they lived back then. It was so interesting!
The relationship between John Adams and his wife was explored in depth. As amazing as he was, his wife was also incredible. Laura Linney did an outstanding job portraying her. The sets and costumes were well done. The script was engaging and moving. I have to say that each week this series kept us wanting more. Honestly I'm a guy who generally doesn't like period movies, but this really appealed to me anyway.  
Bottom line: I would recommend this movie to anyone with an interest in American history or politics, and to anyone who likes a good drama. Really I would recommend this movie to anyone!

I tried the Norelco shaver to keep my head shaved, but it did not work well.  I then tried the Braun Series 7 Pulsonic Shaver, and it did a very good job of both shaving my head (keeping it bald) and, shaving my face.  It is not quite as good as a blade when it comes to shaving your face, but it is much faster than the blade, and does an OK job.  In addition, one of the selling points for me was that you don't have to bother cleaning the electric razor.  You just place it in its cradle and press the cleaning button, and it will automatically clean the razor and set it up again for your next shave.  Overall, it's a very good product.  I recommend it for guys that want to keep their heads shaved.  (Suggestion:  Have your wife or girl friend help you with shaving the back of the head.  It is a lot easier than if you try to do it yourself.)

You get exactly what the product description says you will get. It is a sturdy product and pretty easy to set up. You'll need to wiggle and push some bars into place for the initial set up but once everything is in, the crate is good. The handlebars up top make it easy to move around. It is a bit heavy, but if it were any lighter, the integrity of the crate would probably be compromised. I like how my dog is able to see in all directions. Being able to see his surroundings helps him to feel more calm and comfortable. At night, I drape a sheet over part of the crate to create that "cave-like" feel that helps him feel cozy and sleep well. Overall, I would recommend this product.

I had been looking for a backlit keyboard for a long time, but most of them seem to be very pricey.  I finally found this one on sale for about half off and it's excellent.  The key action is very smooth and quiet and the keys feel solid.  The backlight is nice and I have no problems reading the keys at night.  I have only used the LCD a little bit, but do far it has been very useful.  I like the feature to turn off the windows key, who hasn't hit that in a game and been pulled out to the desktop!  I'm very happy with the purchase and would buy another.

The Litter Locker is the best thing invented since the diaper genie for babies!  I have three cats and this helps me keep the order gone and the clean up is quick and simple.  I love the new black line on the bag when it is coming close to the end!
Everyone with a cat should give this a try!

Wonderful product- I thought my cats would take some time to get used to it, but no problem there. They drink more water than they used to-thats' got to be a good thing healthwise. One likes to drink from the top-she's a faucet drinker- the others like the pool area. I'd recommend this product highly-the price was very reasonable too.

Since the trend seems to be the production and purchase of items that make phone calls, play mp3s, serve as calulators, take pictures, play movies and change the cat litter box, this coffeemaker may not impress some people. It just makes coffee. It uses normal coffee filters (the flat bottom type), brews the coffee and turns off the warming plate after two hours. It does not do anything else. I, personally LIKE that. After all, how many mp3 players does one need? What kind of tech-crazy person wants to make phone calls on their coffee maker? Who can talk before they have had their first cup of coffee in the first place?
If you are looking for a coffee maker that just makes coffee and does it rapidly and without any complicated instructions that must be followed (who can follow complicated instructions before their first cup of coffee, either?) then this would be a good choice. If you want to film a movie with your coffee maker, this is not the coffee maker for you.

I just bought this last weekend, and it is pretty handy.  It does work very well on thick course hair (back, legs, arms and chest) but not so much on fine hair (knuckles, feet) and may require a few passes for those.  I was surprised at how well this worked on my back, at least in the places I could reach.  I love using it in the shower and it is a snap to clean.  One complaint, there is no extension to get to those hard to reach places like some similar products I have seen.  Over all I like it though.

This fourth installment of what has become known as the "Twilight" series is a must-read for anyone who has found themselves sleeplessly reading the first three novels in the course of a very late night. The 700+ page book is as addicting as the first book by Stephanie Meyer, if not more so. The outcome could not have been better for Edward, for Jacob, and, of course, for Bella. Theirs is a completely intertwined love that will last beyond the end of time. It makes me want to be a vampire!

The FURminator is amazing. It is a very durable tool and it performs far beyond expectations. It works equally well for short or long-hair cats. Even better, our two short-hair cats don't mind it and our daughter's long-hair cat actually enjoys it. Use it outside with your cat because it cleans out an amazing amount of hair. When finished, the cat's coat feels very smooth and you will see no shedding for a week or two afterwards.

This review is from: Australia  [Blu-ray] (Blu-ray)
      
I cannot understand how the Oscars could almost completely ignore this epic motion picture. This is old fashioned movie making at its best!. Sure it is sometimes corny and sugar-coated, but at the same time it is 
cruel and poignant. This movie has it all: spectacular cinematography, a sweeping musical score, great performances by the entire cast, laughter, romance, tears, action, you name it. The movie brought back memories of "the Cowboys", "Father Goose", "Pearl Harbor", "The Lion King","Gone with the Wind","Cinema Paradiso" and obviously "The Wizard of Oz". In other words , it is a cinematic celebration set in a continent which culture is very much unknown, and a mystery to many. The director achieved his goal in his homage to his native continent of Australia!. The Blu-ray transfer is magnificent, and surpassed any 35mm projection I have seen in theatres recently. It looked like 70mm in sharpness front projected in full 1080p on my 10.5 foot wide PANAVISION screen. This is a MUST have in any serious film collector's library!

Purchased this Ice Cream Maker after reading the reviews.  It is absolutely wonderful.  Makes Ice Cream in 25 - 30 minutes.  Easy to use and clean.  I store the bucket in my freezer so it is always ready to use.  Had it about 30 days and used it 4 times.  I recommend the Ben and Jerry's cookbook - basic recipes.

Overall, the unit is a decent player. The plastic casing feels cheap, but the function is still pretty nice. It's not the kind of player that will turn heads with looks, features, and bells and whistles, but it does it's job as a nice basic player.
Some people may not like the AA battery usage, but I prefer it since it makes it easy to replace a battery when you can't plug into anything anywhere - like, for example, when traveling. AA batteries are ubiquitous and can be found in a pinch.
Bottom line: If you are looking for a basic mp3 player (and FM tuner) that just does job with being flashy, this is a good buy.

One of my very good memories of my childhood are the Battlestar Gal�ctica movies and series, I am a big fan. The first time I heard about this new production I was very happy, then I read the opinion of other fanatics of the old series about how bad this new series was and I became disappointed. But, because I am a very big fan, it was my duty to saw this new one. After this, I only can say that all the people who rate the new BSG with 5 stars are completely right. This series are very, very , very amusing and I really want to buy it (I own the old series). When I saw the finale of the 13rd chapter I stopped my breathing, �what?, no continuation? It depressed me for a very long time. Now I know that there is a second season to come and I'm eagerly waiting for it. Thank's BSG. Note. The old series was  very good, but it was for another time, this new one is for the present time and I hope for the future years.

Bought the Sansa Fuze weeks ago and have loved it.  It holds much of my collection, plays radio jams, can record form radio and voice, and I was even surprised to find On the Go Deleting and play list making, which wasn't even mentioned on the reviews I read. 
it uses the same proprietary connection cable as other sansas, and needs no new software. I have 3 now that all work with it.
I also bought a rubberish case to protect my investment, but the player's rubber back feels solid an durable, and can't show smudges. 
Its features are its strongest point, as well as its sound.
The only negative is that I sometimes need to click the scroll wheel twice for it to function, as about 5% of the time it is unresponsive.

"3 and a half stars, are you kidding me?"
I know that's what's going through your mind, and probably rightfully so.  I mean, this movie has been lauded as one of the greatest of the decade.  And truthfully speaking, it is a good movie; better than some others I've been forced to endure.  But it's not "great".  That's what this review will tell you - why I say the movie isn't "Great".
Background - I did watch, and quite enjoyed, Batman Begins.  If you haven't seen that movie, you don't need to in order to understand the events of Dark Knight, though some experiences are made better if you did (such as the relationship between Wayne and Rachel).  But what Batman Begins did right is the backstory; how Batman got his training and expertise, as well as his morality and sense of justice.  Also, his basic understanding of the criminal mind is briefly explained here, and his development of the various tools of the trade that he now uses to dole out the justice.  Because of that, it's a good idea to watch Batman Begins first, even if not required, because it sets the stage nicely.  A friend of mine who is a DC comics fan couldn't stand Batman Begins, because, as he put it, "Batman isn't supposed to be that serious".  Maybe not from the comic book world, but the comic book world is designed to be lighthearted so it can be catered to kids.  When you translate that across to a more mature audience, you need to make the character that much more mature.  This is important, because the same methodology applies to Dark Knight, if not more so.
Without spoiling anything, the whole deal behind Dark Knight is that Batman encounters a character who is his exact polar opposite: He's serious, yet treats things such as killing very lightly.  He has no code, no morals, no ethics...only a means to an end.  This is expressed throughout the movie, as the Joker goes to any length to get what he wants.  During the movie this is believed to be a simple crime, but it eventually turns out to be a total twist - proving a point to Batman and in the doing, making Batman violate some of his moral code in order to stop him.  All of this is done very well; in fact, it's clear that the very happy-happy ending of Batman Begins was not appealing to someone in the writer's office, because this one never gets happy-happy.  Some of it is downright depressing, which I suppose is the intent of the movie.
What the movie does right: Christian Bale does a good job of playing Bruce Wayne and Batman respectively.  Bruce Wayne is not involved in this movie nearly as much as the first one and in fact, feels like an afterthought.  There's a lot more focus on Batman this time around, which is as it should be.  Heath Ledger, who I doubt you've not heard about, plays the Joker extremely well.  What some people claim is an inaccurate portrayal, again, is simply a rendition of the comic book character changed to a more mature setting, and it comes across well.  Joker knows exactly what he's doing, but just does not feel remorse for any of it.  He doesn't stick himself into a funnel with some moral code; he does what needs to be done, and understands that in order to stop him, everyone, even the most ethical, would do the same thing when pushed to that limit.  Aaron Eckhart, who some might recognize from "The Core", enters into the story as Harvey Dent, a prosecutor who relies on chance (evident by Dent's frequent flipping of a two-headed coin) to get through his profession.  All of the other actors play their parts decently well, but Ledger stands out above the rest, followed shortly by (in my opinion) Bale, and then Eckhart.  I know Christopher Nolan would have you believe that Eckhart is the shining star, but his performance was marred by a part that effectively was not done properly (more on that in the next section).
What the movie does WRONG: It's all subjective, but there was quite a bit I didn't care for.  First, Batman Begins did a great job at telling a story that was easy to follow along with.  Dark Knight attempted to continue this story by introducing a darker side of Gotham, but in the process did way too much in too short a time.  I don't like when movies attempt to rush what they're doing, or throw too much into the 2 hour slot, and that's exactly what Dark Knight did.  In effect, it was two different movies overlapping one another.  
First, there was the Joker storyline - the center of the movie.  This was done well for the most part.  Then, you had the Two-Face substory, which they treated as an offshoot of the Joker storyline.  In the end it seemed like a good idea, but was horribly implemented - the Two-Face substory should have been a separate movie altogether, because that's how intricate the real story between Wayne and Dent really is.  They had significantly more history than Wayne and Joker.  It ended up being about 20 minutes total of Two-Face action, which I found unacceptable, seeing the reason Two-Face even came into existence according to the movie.  The ending wasn't too great either.
My next complaint had to do with Scarecrow, played again by Cillian Murphy.  There was some association with Joker which was never fully explained, but what really bothered me was the fact that it felt like he was just thrown in without any rhyme or reason.  First it seems like he's trying to help Batman, then it seems like he's trying to help Joker.  On top of all of this it's never explained how he got out of Arkham Asylum in the first place.  Then he's just dismissed without a second glance.  Made no sense to have him in the movie.
Finally, there were a lot of things going on that also were not fully explained or justified.  I can't say anything without spoiling, but suffice it to say, some characters died who didn't really die, some characters got arrested who weren't really arrested, some people get shot but not hurt, some people got stabbed but not hurt, some people just disappeared without a trace.  At the end of the day, some of the things just didn't make any sense.  Like I said, it felt like they were trying to do too much at once instead of just breaking this apart into two movies - which I can tell they could have done and ended up with two pretty good movies instead of one good one.
I still recommend the movie; but it's not for everyone.  Those who were fans of the more story driven Batman Begins might be a little disappointed.  Action and CGI junkies will fall over themselves on this movie; there's a lot going on at almost all times.

This little computer is excellent! I purchased it to use primarily in the coffee shops. It's great! I've used it to type several essay assignments for college while sitting in the coffee shop. The wireless connection works very well! I believe that this is the future of personal computing. It's so compact that I can carry it in the same carrying case as a softcover book. The Linux software is very easy to use as well as Open Office. Plus, the memory cards make file storage a breeze. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a highly portable computer.

This blender comes with a whisk, chopper, and a measuring/mixing cup. The overall design and build quality of the hand blender is pretty impressive. It doesn't feel flimsy or 'plasticy'. 
You also have to remember it's basically an immersion blender.  Don't buy this expecting to just wave this thing around some fruits and have everything magically puree into a smoothie.
It does speed up preparation time once you get a hang on how the hand blender/wand works.  The whisk and chopper allows the Cuisinart to expand it's role in the kitchen.

I have two long-haired kittens and I just don't know what I'd do without the Furminator!  Recommended to me by a friend, I bought it here on Amazon and have been using it ever since.  I am truly amazed at how much hair it removes without scratching my cats skin - one of my kittens that hated the regular cat brush tolerates the Furminator just fine.  It's particularly useful on their very bushy tails and I've had a couple of brushing sessions where I had almost as much hair removed as you see in the ads.
Don't listen to any of the claims that it cuts your pet's hair - I can assure you it doesn't.  If it did, it would always remove hair which it does not do since eventually no more is brushed out.  My only difficulty using the Furminator is that you must remove the hair after every stroke so that it does not end up back on your pet.  Since many pets are quite squirmy during brushing it can be a challenge to remove the hair (especially when there's a lot of static) and not let your pet get too far away.
I can't speak for its effectiveness on dogs, but as a cat caretaker I can definitely advise you to go out and get one!!

I love this series. I really enjoyed the first season and the second just got better. As an avid reader of historical fiction, this movie was an eye-treat. I know it is not accurate but I didn't care because the story is gripping and the actors are first class. Not to mention the AMAZING setting and LUSH wardrobe. I can't rave enough about this series. It got me so intrigued by Tudor England that I found myself opening encyclopedias and reading about it to know more. I wish they made more movies like this.
I heartily recommend it and envy those who are about to enjoy it for the first time.

Fast startup, convenient icon dock with firefox, gmail, youtube, and open office applications. The great thing is that the Open office word is supported and can be read by Microsoft office. Internet browsing is very fast. Connectivity is strong and the windows can be put at full screen, so the 7 inches looks a little bigger. Everything is custimizable from the dock, desktop, and displayed icons. Popular websites like ebay,craigslist,yahoo, youtube,google are all set as easy access links. About 10 games like tetris and solitaire. The webcam is amazing! good quality. You can record videos and take pictures. You can make the vid negatice, black and wide, flip it, and add cool effects. Youtube videos are overall pretty good quality, depending on what your watching. Battery lasts forever. Extremely portable at less than 2 pounds and really tiny. All my friends and family love it. So do I. Best buy this year.

I just started Juicing and didn't want to spend a lot on my first juicer.  You can spend a lot of money on a juicer.  For the price this juicer can't be beat.  I was amazed at how quickly and thoroughly this juicer produced juice.  
EASY TO CLEAN
I read somewhere that it doesn't make sense to get a juicer that takes a lot of work to clean becuz then you won't use it.  Well that's not a problem with this one.  Takes about 2 minutes.
EASY TO USE
I was a little overwhelmed with the juicer at first but set up was easy and I was juicing in no time.  Now the hardest part is figuring out what to juice but there are books for that.  One nice thing is that the Breville manual includes recipes for using the pulp.  I thought that was kind of cool.

This is an excellent camera, it fulfills all my needs, I'd have really appreciated a few more options but I can't really complain.(I wanted to be able to mount the camera upside down or sideways and would have liked a feature to flip the video so that the resulting pictures were always the correct orientation when played back... but the feature is not there... ah well), I'd also have liked a 'stop frame' mode, take a shot every 10 seconds and pull them together as a movie...
Other than these 'missing' features the camera is excellent, the small size, the ruggedness, the battery life, the video clarity, the image stabilization, and the low light behavior are all excellent (you will notice graininess at low light but all cameras do this and this is not the worst by any means)
My only gripe is that the video standard used in the resulting movie files is not very widely used yet so finding programs that can edit the video is difficult or expensive.

The Oral B EB417 dual head power brush replacement does a great job of getting into tight places, reaching back teeth, removing plaque, has a nice gum massage action, and leaves your mouth and teeth feeling clean and very refreshed. The two heads work twice as good as one, but may take some getting used to if your used to a single brush head. 
Using it by gently guiding it over your teeth, and letting it do all the work, it will last a long time too. It was nearly three months before I had to replace mine. Most Oral B brushes are interchangeable with all Oral B units. This one though, according to the buying info here, may not be used with the Cross Action brush. It will also indicate when it's time for replacement by the fading colors of the bristles.(the box shows as good picture of new and used). Just a little of your favorite toothpaste goes a long way too!
It's a 5 star product, but unless you are just one person who just wants to try it out, the better buy would be to purchase the three pack. It's almost like getting one free. My pack also came with different color rings, that fit on the brush at the base and is nice for families to tell the brushes apart. It's nice to have a spare for unexpected guests as well.

This is unquestionably my favorite Disney movie of all time. Great music, great story, humor, this movie has it all. Snatch it up before it is no longer available!
The DVD features on this edition of The Little Mermaid are wonderful! The deleted scenes are roughly animated, but are delightful. Each is introduced by the co-writers/co-directors, and the missing scenes even provide you with information about the story never before known (did you know that the Ursula is King Triton's SISTER?!) The making of featurrette is a 45-minute extraveganza that goes into all the details you ever wanted to know about the development, creation, and even ramifications of the film. And did you know that Disney at one time was developing a Little Mermaid theme park attraction ride? This DVD allows you to not only learn about the ride and it's development, but also to take a virtual ride on the attraction itself - as it would have been if it had ever been realized. The 10-minute Disneypedia is in my opinion the most valuable feature on the entire DVD (besides the film itself, of course). It combines animation with live footage of undersea creatures. It is especially wonderful for children because it not only entertains, it EDUCATES! And that is the most wonderful thing of all!
This is a gem of a DVD... Don't miss it!

I am constantly playing the MMORPG , City of Heroes / Villians!

I do not like hunching over keyboards to play, so was looking at getting myself the seemingly popular  N52  , but- I am "extremely picky" about colors / asthetics and therefore 'had' to get the  Saitek PZ31A Since (on default setting) it has the similar lovely "blue" glow to match my computer, speakers, keyboard and trackball, - all blue all the time- LOL.
I had it custom set up and playing within 15 minutes of opening the box, and so far so good, (just got it) I have a strong feeling that this will make my game experience much more comfortable, and another plus, is that my speed/ movement/ skill will also improve slightly! I also have rather large hands , and it fits great, and the thumbstick is so much better than trying to press "WASD" for me. I have my attack chains programmed in just the right way, and have even made fewer mistakes already. Greatest gift I got myself lately!!!

This is my review after buying this fresh incarnation. 
I have the fifth generation iPod. Did not acquire the 6th gen because I feel that that update last year was not much of an upgrade. Now, this offers no major improvement as well, but I still bought it for the following reasons:
1) At 120 GB and 249 USD, it still offers a good USD over gigabyte value. Good as an extra external harddisk for my other hobby: photography. 2) Im planning to buy the new in-ear iPod earphone with controls that might not be backward compatible with my 5th gen. Although I wasnt able to test this in-canal two-drivered, tweetered earphone (not in the stores yet), Im betting that Apple tweaked and appropriately consulted with expert sound engineers. Im still a believer in Apple's meticulousness in sound. I wont forget that iPod offered best mp3 sound (you would think it's coming from an audio-discman) in its first launch. The one with controls is in demo, control 'pad' is very thin and convenient, sounds about the same,  
3) the battery of my 5th gen is now performing to just about 60% of its original capacity
4) I like the new black color, it's not black black, but approaching charcoal. A rugged color to me that doesnt 'get dirty' easily. 
5) Ive been wanting the song search function since my library is now 3000+. (why didnt Apple apply a firmware for this for the 5th gen?) 
6) Substantial battery improvement as well. 
7) There's a considerable reduction in size. With silicon case added, it's equal to my 5th gen's size.
8) Less lags  compared to my 5th gen (although fed a library of 3000+ songs plus several movies and video podcasts)
Now, my objections:
1) Why didn't they include the shake/shuffle function. Is it because it's hard-drive based? Do people really shakesohard to do that big damage on the hard-drive?
2) There's a general impression that this iPod classic is being `left out'," for example just with upgrades that's only firmware-based. The word "classic" in itself already connotes "old," and other negative things. I hope Apple doesnt put this previous flagship down so much. In forums, there's already much comment on how "this update is not included in the classic..." are all these intentional so the iPod Touch would increase its sales? No gratitude at all to this iconic model which brings so much memory. No gratitude when it comes to business strategy? Just for me, I wont consider iPod Touch until its flash-based memory breaks 60 GB at least and price gets below 300 USD. With all the video podcasts available, 32 GB (at 400 USD at that!) is just not enough.

I am a laptop DJ, using a macbook pro with one FW800 port and Native Instruments Traktor 3.2 software for DJing.  My sound card is using the FW400 port while my midi controller is on USB port.  
My local hard drive is too small for my music collection so I decided to get an external drive for my music. The Lacie drive is sleek looking, solidly constructed, and quiet (fanless).  It is working quite well for me, as I need the speed of FW800 for realtime DJing.  The bus speed of 800Mbps allows me to load tracks as quickly as possible which is important when DJing live.  While it's not quite as fast as the local drive, it is fast enough for my purposes.
I bought two Lacie drives, one for playing live and the other as a backup.  I really like that Lacie put 2 FW800 ports, allowing me to daisy chain both drives together for an easy backup.  I use SilverKeeper 2.0 (freeware) as my backup software.  V2.0 is compatible with 10.3.9-10.5.x.  It is easy to use and I am quite happy with it.  I did not use any of the other software that came with the Lacie drive.
I am quite pleased with my purchase.

I am totally blown away by the large number of negative, and really mean-sounding reviews that are here, slamming this book/DVD.  
There is a medium, Esther Hicks, who is able to channel a group of non-physical beings who call themselves "Abraham", and basically Abraham's teachings are what you will find in "The Secret", ie. The Law of Attraction, only in a more physical-human orientation.
I heard a seminar by Abraham, and an angry woman demanded to know: "If I'm asking, (and I AM)....and the Universe is answering (and that's YET to be seen), ....then where the hell is my STUFF?"  And Abraham pointed out to her that in her anger and frustration, she was shutting off the stream of what she wanted, and attracting more anger and frustration.
A lot of the negative reviewers here sound like this woman. They are negative, attract negative experiences, and so they "tell it like it is" with more negativity. Such negative reviews don't serve you.
There are a lot of people who are upbeat, and therefore attract more of that. When such people use this law, the results can be breathtaking.  If you're going to listen to anybody in life, listen to the WINNERS.  Positive people are able to make this work with very little effort.  And as for the negative people? Once they get that chip off their shoulders, it'll work for them, too, if they choose.
The DVD version is a wonderful way to quickly grasp the process. I recommend it.
The book version goes more into detail, and is beautifully laid out.
The audio book version features the voices of Rhonda Byrne and all the teachers reading the text. It's my favorite. Rhonda reads "The Secret" lovingly and eloquently, and it's a joy to listen to!

It works well and it's easy to store and clean. I just wish it had a timer for automatic shut off. The instuction manual is not that detailed either but this product can't be found in other brands like Cuisinart which I am very loyal to. I only used it once since I bought it but it had great results. The recipe for basic plain yogurt calls for an unnecessary ingrediant - dry milk. I didn't use it and I used less yogurt culture (just a third of what was recommended) yet the result was perfect.

Sonicare makes the best electronic toothbrush. 75% of that is the brush. If you let the brush do the work, and don't press too hard, each brush will last 6 months, just in time for your dentist to really take you to the cleaners. Expensive? Not really. $25 a year for brushes isn't that much when you consider how much you'll save on a periodontist.
Admitted, I've seen the brush go up in price twice in two years, so now I buy six at a time if I find them on "sale."

Anyone who views the new Battlestar Galactica with objective eyes would have to agree with the idea that this show far surpasses the original. This is how remakes should be made: Not slavishly copying the original, or smugly commenting on it from time and distance, but discarding the chaff and retaining the aspects that of the property that remain relevant.
Admittedly, I was never a big fan of the original show. I missed the first episode way back when (it aired the weekend I went away to college), and I never really caught back up. That, plus I harbored a grudge for what Glenn Larceny (as I remember author Harlan Ellison calling him) did to Buck Rogers. But Ronald Moore and Co. have taken the concepts of the original and done an incredible job of thinking them through.
The most obvious alteration is the human-appearing Cylons. While this could be considered to be done out of budgetary concerns, it serves the purpose of increasing the dramatic tension as members of the Galactica's fleet serve as Cylon moles, sometimes against their wills. Additionally, the political and spiritual connotations have been played up this time, at no expense to the action. And I would even go so far to suggest that the conflicts among the humans here, especially toward the end of the first season, are nearly as hard-fought as the battles with the Cylons.
One complaint about the series that possibly has some credence is that the show is relentlessly bleak. This is arguably true. I, for one, always watch the subtitle at the beginning of each episode that counts the number of human lives remaining on Galactica and the other ships from the initial 50,000 (on the 8/5/05 episode, the count was down to 47,000 and change). While things could lighten up a little for the fleet, we need to consider that the fate of the human race is at stake here at all times. Also, I have heard complaints that, among the racial/gender switch-ups done among the characters (i.e., Starbuck/that guy from the A-Team to Starbuck/attitudinal blonde chick)that African-Americans actors have taken a hit since Boomer and Tigh are now played as an Asian woman and a drunken Caucasian man, respectively. But the greater spectrum of races and sexes on display is encouraging. Just give us a good Black regular character soon!
Finally, if great effects, powerful writing, and good acting aren't good enough for the diehard Galactica fanboys, there's this: the beloved Original Apollo, Richard Hatch, has a recurring role. So the new guys respect the old school, after all.

I think Ray Stevenson is a great performer and I hope this film raises some awareness on his Rome role (an outstanding series where you can see two seasons of his ability to carry a show). 
The film runs at 103 minutes and has a variety of short documentaries to supplement. Disc 2 is strictly the Digital Copy in SD. In watching the documentaries, the crew was making a point of high color saturation and tons of darkness. Admittedly, I only recall two daytime shots outdoors and they were both of the precinct building, so white balance had little bearing. Other settings on this did not seem to matter as much since the grain and blurring of colors appeared entrenched in some scenes, especially the church scene where they had deliberately over exposed the rainbow reflections onto the skin tones. The picture does look good as a whole, but the display never seems to get tested that often. Several outdoor night shots were obviously filmed with a different camera and make for some nice slow-mo angles.
The sound of 7.1 DTS is always a welcome addition, but really it only got used in the glass grinding sequence and a couple parts of the final shootout. The music was mixed primarily to the front three channels since most was hard rock and no real score.
The extras were short and slightly informative, but could have been combined into one medium piece. The gun fans will get the most out of them. Definitely not a 5 star Blu Ray, but a worthwhile addition for fans of the film.

Our cat doesn't like to be FURminated. He won't let you touch him if he doesn't want to. Based on my statement, you may think that I'm one of the people who will say that FURminator is a bad product &amp; it doesn't work. Not true. I think this brush is one of the best on the market, unfortunately, not every cat likes to be groomed, so I had to learn a couple of tricks to make it work. I hope some of them may be useful for your feline friends. 
Trick #1 Try grooming your cat right after it woke up or better yet, start while it is sleeping. It will take some time for him/her to realize &amp; react to their enemy - FURminator. I usually have at least 5 minutes before my cat starts fighting &amp; biting. Trick #2 Give you cat some treats, place them on the floor &amp; while he/she eats them, groom as there is not tomorrow because you usually have 2-3 minutes max :) Don't do it too often, otherwise giving treats will be associated with constant unpleasant activity for them. Trick #3 (for indoor cats) put your cat in front of the window or door, preferably where it can see some action, e.g. flying birds &amp; and start grooming as soon as you notice that your cat puts his hunting instincts above everything else, including FURminator.
It sounds like a lot of work, but it's worth it: my cat has less hairballs &amp; everybody compliments on his black, shiny fur!

Loved the movie, enjoyed the extras (especially the director's commentary), hated the package. I'm fine with eco-friendly packaging, but someone got cute with this one, and there's a flap on the inner box that catches on the flap on the outer box/sleeve, which makes removing the inner box a toughie. Solution is to insert the inner box backwards, but it shouldn't have been necessary. At least they didn't have the evil seal on the thing (you know--the one that's meant to guarantee that the DVD or CD is factory new and is hard to get off completely).

This review is from: The Dark Knight (Two-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy) (DVD)
      
In "Batman Begins," Christopher Nolan managed to do what few directors could do -- create a dark, gritty atmosphere around an all-too-human Batman, who fights for the oppressed with quiet intensity.
That moody murk is only intensified in the breathtaking, harrowing "Dark Knight," which fills itself with blasts of action, psychological twists and a shocking tragedy. Nolan pulls no punches for our dark knight or his ever-endangered Gotham City, but brilliant acting of the hero and villains is what truly elevates the second of Nolan's Batman movies to a work of cinematic art.
Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) is continuing to fight the good fight for Gotham, even when he gets hurt in a fight against Scarecrow and some Batman impersonators.
So unsurprisingly, he's is feeling fairly in his crimefighting abilities, especially since the new DA Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is a morally-upright good-guy. But Batman isn't prepared for the Joker (Heath Ledger) a mad clownish psychopath who has hired himself out to the mob to destroy their worst enemy, the Dark Knight. He starts blackmailing Batman by killing Gotham citizens, and saying he won't stop until Batman turns himself in.
But even when captured, the Joker has an ace up his sleep -- Dent and Rachel Dawes' (Maggie Gyllenhaal) lives. And after a devastating loss, Batman finds himself dealing with the Joker taking all of Gotham hostage, and the maddened and disfigured Dent bringing vigilante justice to all those whom he thinks have wronged him. Only Batman has a chance of stopping even one of them -- let alone both -- but doing so may tarnish the Dark Knight forever.
Most directors would have given this movie a distinctly comic-book, slick pop-culture feel. But no matter how hard you search, there's not a single hint in "The Dark Knight" that anything kitschy or campy came before it, or that it was originally a comic book. Instead Christopher Nolan creates a movie as dark, tightly-wound and intense as Batman himself.
And Nolan's skills are even more polished this time around -- lots of kinetic action, vicious dogs and car chases, including the rather silly-looking Batpod and the tanklike Batmobile. The dialogue is drizzled with dry humor ("That isn't exactly what I had in mind when I said I wanted to inspire people"," Batman says, looking at a bunch of impersonators), mostly to temper the overhanging sense of horror and apprehension.
This is especially true whenever the Joker's corrosive presence is onscreen, since he's all too happy to stick pointy objects in people -- he's creepier than a thousand boogeymen. And Nolan is not afraid to further darken the storyline by inflicting yet another personal tragedy on Batman. His direction is painfully delicate as he explores Wayne's sorrow and guilt.
But the most striking aspect of "The Dark Knight" is Nolan's delvings into morality -- The Joker has none and Dent's becomes horribly perverted, but we're reminded that there are some who will not be corrupted even if they lose what is most precious. It's almost a doom'n'gloom movie, but the faint hints of optimism and hope keep it from being TOO overwhelmingly dark.
Christian Bale is simply perfection as Bruce Wayne/Batman, using his handsomely chiseled face and piercing eyes to best advantage -- even in the most tragic scenes, where you can practically see Wayne's soul bleeding. And he has a difficult character to wrangle with -- not only does he have to expose Batman's pain and struggles, but also his inner incorruptibility.
On the flipside, the late Heath Ledger is blindingly brilliant as the sadistic, creepy, gleefully malign Joker, and he chews the scenery as few actors could. He's pretty spine-chilling, actually -- the Joker is a true "agent of chaos," whose intent is to seize Gotham, and corrupt Batman's soul along the way. There's also a solid (and underrated) supporting cast -- Eckhart is outstanding as an upstanding DA whose morality becomes horribly perverted (along with his handsome face), Gyllenhaal has a solid role that she plays well, and Michael Caine is a quiet, steady flame as the ever-faithful, dryly sardonic Alfred.
The two-disc special edition isn't quite as special as I had hoped (deleted scenes?), but it has a serviceable bunch of extras anyway, including a digital copy of the selfsame movie, galleries for pictures, IMAX renderings of certain scenes, a bunch of mocked-up news programs from "Gotham Tonight" and a documentary about the making of the film. I smell double-dipping in this movie's future, especially since the blu-ray is reportedly far better endowed with extras.
"The Dark Knight" is suffused with darkness and some truly ghastly villains, but the magnificent acting and dryly witty script are what really make this a masterpiece. Utterly astounding -- and promises better yet to come.

I have owned the same unit for 2.5 years and love it!  At first the programming was difficult, mostly because I am not a directions reader, but once I figured it out it was smooth sailing.  I travel a lot so am often changing it from "at home" to "on the road" portions and times, so maybe that keeps me trained on how to use it.  
The only problems I have had with it were my fault.  The "kids" figured out one day that they could bump into it and get food out of it.  Imagine my surprise (not really) when I realized that when you put the container on you are supposed to turn it and lock it in.  Hello!  Me not reading directions again! lol I haven't had a problem again.  I also love how my cats seem to know when its about to dump.  They will start running toward it before I even hear the intro grind to food dispensing.  When I first got it, it took about 3 days for my cat to realize what the noise was and to enjoy and not be afraid of it.  
Please, if you buy this unit, read the directions, give it some time it your cat doesn't warm up to it at first, and sit back and enjoy being able to walk into the kitchen without being begged for food.  When this one finally goes kaput, I will definitely buy another!

5 stars for hardware, 1 for software
I had this camcorder and a canon HV20.  The HF100 a much better camcorder in several ways that are important to me.  1) Tapeless - that means I can transfer to computer a lot faster and earlier.  2) Responsive - little time lag between press of record button and actual recording, compared to HV20.   3) Same great image quality - i can't tell much difference in quality between HF100 and HV20, even though HF100 had higher recorded resolution, and the HV20 had a larger sensor.  4) compactness.   Similar to the HV20, the HF100 had not much of a wide-angle to speak of, but the wide converter lens (which i do not have) is lighter and cheaper.
The HV20 does have better battery life.   The HF100 had about 1.5 hour.  I never had to worry about battery in the HV20.   The H.264 video recorded by HF100 plays fine on a core 2 duo 2.4 GHz, but cannot keep up on a dual core 2.0 GHz AMD box -- you need relatively fast computers.  Not canon's fault though.
The bundled software is unstable to a point of being unusable (on two separate XP boxes I tried). After many attempts (amid reboots, etc) I finally managed to convert one video clip to a resolution for web use, but the image quality is shameful.  I tried several software that claimed to support AVCHD without success, and eventually worked out a conversion workflow that involves storing downscaled uncompressed video, which is rather painful.

I found this product reviewed in a magazine and did some further research. I found the best price on Amazon and purchased it. It has lived up to its billing. Very handy, versatile, easy to download, and takes good footage of all the activities I want to capture on film.

This little sucker packs a punch! I just completed a Wilton Cake decorating class, and was told by the instructor not to use a hand mixer becasuse the motor would burn up. Little did she know, Kitchenaid had this awsome mixer! I have made icing, cake, cookies and dough with no problems at all. I love how easy the clean up is. Don't pass this one up, just buy it now!!!

Very good book.  Has many good ideas as most others have stated.  However, I found it falls apart in giving definitive concepts for executing projects.  He touches project execution only superficially and any related details are not well thought out.  Thus, you are left with confusion in how to handle projects.
I find this especially disappointing when he defines a project as any thing we need to get done that is comprised of more than a single action step.  Wouldn't that be most of our work worlds?  I believe so.  Especially, if you have managerial responsibilities.
On pages 54 and 55, he explains that "most of the time" you only need the single step (horizontal) method.  He states "Sometimes, however, you may need greater rigor and focus to get a project under control" and "every once in a while you may need to develop a more formal structure or plan..."  Those appear to be the reasons he doesn't include a way to integrate projects, with their various sequences and scopes, into his system.  To state that you MAY need to manage a project or that ONCE IN A WHILE you will need a way to plan and manage them, is to ignore reality for most people, again, especially those in management.
In summary, it's still a very practical and useful book.  But, you will be left on your own to figure out a way to plan and successfully get to the envisioned outcome of a project.

This is a great invention! I registered for the one in blue and ended up going back to the store to get another one in white to use when I'm washing the blue one. It's must less hassle than the receiving blankets. It keeps the  baby warm without having loose blankets around to worry about. My son likes to have his arms out when he sleeps. So if he's resisting me wrapping him all up I just wrap him just below his armpits so his arms are free. Then his whole body is still wrapped up and warm. I would recommend getting one or two of these for your newborn. This along with that sleeping sack type thing are the best for newborns since loose blankets with have you worried about SIDS. This keeps the blanket totally confined. I would recommend this!!

Next to the iPhone, the iPod touch is one of the greatest handheld devices ever conceived. I wouldn't call this an MP3 or even an MP4 player, because it is so much more. The iPod touch combines a portable media player, a portable gaming device, a PDA, a net-tablet/netbook, a VOIP phone, an internet radio, an ebook reader, and even a musical instrument in to one very thin, very beautiful, and very intuitive device.
As a PMP, the iPod touch is fantastic. The built-in speaker might not be of audiophile quality, but it is one of my favourite features. I am now able to listen to music while doing things that wouldn't permit me to wear my headphones, and I don't need a docking station to do so. Also, the new Apple Genius playlist compiler works very well, and I find myself using it all of the time. Video quality is top notch as well. I definitely appreciate the ability to switch between the filled-screen and uncropped modes. The iPod touch handles skipping through long parts of video without lag, which is also impressive.
As a gaming device, the iPod touch has really impressed me. The processor of the iPod touch 2G is far more powerful than the PSP (though the graphics card isn't quite as good) and because the touch relies completely on its flash memory, games load in seconds compared to wasting half of your flight waiting for the dismal loading times on the PSP. The graphics are far above expectations for an iPod, and can even rival some decent PSP games. iPod touch games are also far cheaper than comparable PSP and DS games. The biggest drawback is obviously the lack of buttons, but touch games overcome that with unique methods of game input (touch, motion, sound, etc). In my opinion, the iPod touch is like a cross between a PSP, a DS, and a Wii when it comes to gaming.
Additionally, the iPod touch is a good net-tablet. The internet loads quickly, and most sites work just as they would in the normal Safari browser. I have yet to come in to problems with the lack of flash/java support, as many web developers create iPod/iPhone versions of their sites to circumvent problem. I'm sure flash and java will be supported in future updates, so it's only a matter of time anyway. Typing with the onscreen keyboard really isn't as bad as many are suggesting, and auto-correction can now be turned off if you don't like it (though I think it is brilliant).
Some nice PDA features are pre-loaded on to the iPod touch, and you can download many more off of the App Store for free. The calendar is one of the better mobile calendars I have used, and it is much better than the one that was first launched for iPod touch in 2007. By far though, my favourite PDA app is Mail. It works just like the Mail app in Mac OS X, and it can read Word docs, PDF files, Excel spreadsheets, Powerpoint shows, and all of the iWork equivalents. It checks your Mail periodically and will alert you to new messages (you can adjust/turn off this feature). Contacts can be entered as well, and you can add pictures for your contacts. I like how you can specify the country of the phone number by adding the country code, and it will automatically put the spaces in the correct places.
Other features on the latest iPod touch include the VOIP phone functionality (free 3rd party app required), though you'll need to purchase a compatible microphone. Other free 3rd party apps add internet radio; pianos, guitars, flutes, and drums; and an ebook reader which is also capable of buying new books on the internet.
I've had my iPod touch 2G for a while now, and I am still constantly impressed by its excellent functionality.
And yes Apple, it is the "funnest" iPod ever.

Initially, I was going to wait to upgrade after reading so many negative reviews.  After using it, I think it a great product and the graphics are excellent.  It took me less than 5 minutes to decipher the new toolbar and locate some functions, but after that, no problems.  I've never been on a learning curve, with an expert certification, it took me no time to learn these programs.  Overrall, I would have given MS Office Pro 2007 five (5) stars, but they failed to upgrade the toolbar in Publisher.  I did not get that.  Great improvements to Outlook-color scheme, views of contacts, etc.  The transition of upgrading from 2003 to 2007 went smoothly.  Microsoft goes above and beyond, when it comes to customer support.  It's worth the investment.

Claims.   Some more gaudy than others but all products make claims, including this Pro EverSharp Electric Knife Sharpener which made good on all its claims.  
It's easy to use, effective in what it does and the outcome is a sharper knife, even the ones with serated edges, than you had before.    Around my house, we LIKE easy!    
We also like quality and effectiveness which this sharpener delivers.   To be fair for potential buyers, don't expect surgical razor edges after running the blade through the simple cycles.    If you press too hard, the grinding wheels will stop, but you'll get the feel for the right pressure within a knife or two.  
It definitely beats the draconian hand held sharpeners that we've all used and, if your experiences are similar to my own, have cut ourselves by accident.  (I still have a Thankgiving sharpening scar from 1977 to prove my point).   
No worries on this sharpener unless you're really trying to cut yourself eh?      Anyway, it's good value for the money and makes a good gift for your family and friends.    Let your enemies use those old hand held sharpeners and save this Pro EverSharp sharpener for the good folk!

I HAVE ANOTHER BREAD MAKER THAT IS SINGLE PADDLE AND ITS QUITE OLD, 15 YEARS, SO I NEVER GAVE IT A THOUGHT HOW MUCH BETTER A TWO PADDLE BREAD MAKER WOULD BE, WELL I FOUND OUT, ITS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST THING I EVER DID!

CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THIS ONE!!!
THE ONLY THING I DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT IT WAS THE SIZE, IT IS WIDE, SO KEEPING IT IN A CABINET TAKES LOTS OF ROOM, BUT I WOULD STILL BUY IT SHOULD I DECIDE TO GET ANOTHER.
GOOD LUCK AND GOOD BAKING TO ANYONE PURCHASING THIS MACHINE.

This is a very nice pod brewer.  It has a large water tank, and options to change the size of cup you're using.  It has a cup setting and a mug setting, and each of these has a small, medium and large setting.  Through a little trial and error, you can find a setting that works for almost any cup or mug you have.  
The machine works well with Senseo pods, but other pods seem to be a little large, like the Melitta pods.  When using these, you have to use the larger two pod holder, not a big deal, but something to be aware of.  There is an insert you can purchase that allows you to use your own coffee rather than the more expensive pods, however it didn't work in my HD7832.  It probably works well in the older models and hopefully someone will come out with one for this machine as well.
In addition to coffee and tea, we also use it to heat water for hot cocoa for the kids.  We still use our 12-cup coffee maker, but this is nice if you're in a hurry and just need one or two cups fast.

This series is one of the best things I have ever seen on TV. It brought that very important history alive and it made me appreciate the great contribution of John Adams to our history. He was indeed a great man. The acting was first-rate and the settings were magnificent. I have been thoroughly delighted. The special features were very interesting also.It would be wonderful if more similar movies could be done on America's history.

I've drank coffee all my life.  Even my mother use to give me coffee with milk in my bottle when I was just a baby.  I was probably a stressed-out, high-strung, irrepressible shaky little bundle of nerves all through my child life.  
I can't remember any day in my life that I haven't had any coffee in the morning, although I will say that I don't care to drink coffee throughout the day like some people do.  I'll drink my six cups of coffee only in the morning before school or work and that will be it for me for the rest of the day.  I'll know I've had enough coffee when people see me glowing in the dark when I rush out of the house early in the morning. Some mornings, I've polished off a whole pot of coffee.   I don't have to be at work till 8 AM but I still get up at around 4 AM so I can start slamming coffee.  Sometimes, I may fall asleep again in front of my first cup of coffee, but when I snap out of my drowsiness, I'll gulp that cold cup down and then rush to the kitchen to make my next cup.  I may slam about 4 or 5 more cups of coffee into me within the next half hour before I bolt out the door to start my day.  I don't know how some people can just fly out of bed and then fly out the door to get on with their day without coffee.  Of course, some people will rush out to the local Starbuck's at the corner and buy that one four dollar cup of coffee and that will be all that they need for the day.  Just one cup?  And at about four freakin' dollars a cup?  Forget that!
Now listen up coffee lovers.  This Keurig coffee maker is the greatest coffee maker I have ever experienced.  It'll heat up water instantly and will having you drinking your first cup of coffee within the first minute you turn your Keurig on in the morning.  It has a built in timer so that you can set it to be ready to brew your first cup the moment you approach your coffee maker if you're someone who just can't wait a whole minute for it to be ready. I've become more patient since I bought my Keurig.  
Now here's what's really unique about the Keurig coffee maker.  It brews one cup at a time.  What you buy for coffee are called K-cups.  Pre-packaged cups of various flavored coffees that you put in the machine to brew one cup of coffee.  There are hundreds of different flavors of national and international coffees (caffeinated and decaffeinated), and  various flavored teas, and cocoas that you buy in boxes and keep in a basket or their original boxes next to your Keurig machine.  
When you buy your Keurig coffee maker, you will get an assortment of various flavored coffees and teas to sample to get you started with understanding the beauty of this great new coffee maker that you've brought into your home.  But, like I said, there are hundreds of other flavored coffees designed in the K-cup format for your Keurig coffee maker.  You'll get order forms and website ordering information available with your Keurig.  
I've bought my Keurig at a Linen and Things department store, but there are other stores that sell the Keurig as well.  I was told that you can get one at Target, but my local Target doesn't seem to have it.  Anyway, at Linen and Things, they also carry only a couple of flavored K-cup coffees sold next to the Keurig.  Usually, I'll see some K-cups from Green Mountain who I think is directly licensed and distributed with the Keurig coffee maker.  Their K-cups sell at $9.99 per box (of 18 K-cups).  So, at that price, plus California sales tax (7.75%) that works out to about 59.8 cents per cup of coffee.  That's really not too bad but you can still get it cheaper if you shop smart.  Even when you order these K-cups on line directly with the K-cup companies, you'll still pay about 55 cents per cup PLUS the cost of shipping, which makes each cup even more expensive. 
I've learned that the best deal available is by buying my K-cups directly through Amazon.  There are various sources that are selling K-cups through Amazon and still charge shipping costs, but there are a few K-cup distributors that sell K-cups at the lowest price possible, plus charge NO tax or shipping fees.  Through Amazon, I see that Target sells a box of K-cups for $59.99 and that's for 108 K-cups.  Even without the cost of shipping (yet to be added), that still works out to 55 cents per cup, minimum.  So, Sorry Target, I think I'll pass.  That is not the best deal.
I buy my K-cups at $20 for two boxes of 25 K-cups each. (50 K-cups for twenty bucks). With no sales tax and free shipping so that works out to just 40 cents per cup.  Just forty cents!!!   And there are many flavors available to choose from.  So YOU tell me.  Would your rather pay four dollars for a cup of coffee (like at Starbucks), or just 40 cents per cup?  Sure, your cup may be a little smaller, but you can always have another cup, and then another cup, and then another cup, and then another cup, and then another cup, and so on and so on and so on...... How about 10 cups of coffee for four bucks, instead of just one?
You can also buy a special reusable K-cup filter so that you can still brew your own coffee from the can if you prefer.  This Keurig is not just limited to manufactured K-cups.  
So, check it out my fellow coffee lovers. You'll love having this Keurig in your house when you have guests.  They will love having options of which flavored coffee they'd like to try, if you'll keep various flavors available.  I still like trying new coffees.  I generally like to stick to the more BOLD flavored coffees.  Call me crazy but I enjoy a mildly bitter harsh burn in my throat when I'm drinking my coffee.  "Tres Intense" (which I guess means Extra Bold) is a common term I see on the boxes of my favorite K-cup coffees.  So far, my favorite K-cup comes from Van Houtte and it's called "Eclipse Blend."  I've ordered about six boxes of it last month.  I'm down to two boxes already so I better order some more soon.
I love my Keurig!  If you're a coffee connoisseur like me, you'll love this machine too.

I was desperately searching for something to brush my new cat with to try to get off the excess hair.  I am not used to the hair shedding all around my house!  My Vet actually told me about this item that sold at their clinic for $40.  I searched on Amazon and found it for almost half the price.  The product works.  My only complaint is the mess it makes because it works.  I advise to brush the pets either outside or in the garage to not make a hairy mess in the house.  But I can't complain, it's only doing it's job!

This little laptop (netbook) does exactly everything that I was looking for.  The portability is unmatched.  There is no need for a separate laptop bag as this computer fits into almost any bag you might already be carrying with you.  The screen is extremely crisp and and makes it easy to read text.  The Linpus OS is, however, extremely limited.  The system was designed for ease of use and access to the features that the laptop was intended.  Even with the modest processor and RAM allotment, the hardware adapts well to any OS change.  I switched to a version of Ubuntu, and aside from a couple minor (and fixable) incompatibilities, my Aspire One is now a fully functional laptop.  With the upgraded OS, I was able to easily network this computer onto my home Wifi and and have access to all the files on my desktop.  This feature really eliminates the need for a lot of physical storage on the laptop itself.  The 8gb SSD is more than enough space to run any OS and store most of the files that someone would want on a device such as this.  At the time that I purchased this laptop, I also ordered a 16gb SD card for additional storage, but I rarely use it.  
There have been some comments/complaints on the internet about the incessant fan noise from this computer.  I am really feeling that this problem is limited to the XP version with the HDD.  The Linpus version with the SSD is extremely quiet.  
Only con:  Battery life.  2-2.5 hours is the longest amount of time this computer will run on a single charge.  Be prepared to keep it plugged in at home or work and never stray too far from an outlet.
4.5/5 Stars.  For the cost, it cannot be matched.

Don't be misled by the negative comments on some of the customer photos.  It is true that too much coffee remains in the grinder for perfection.  If you need such perfection and you have the money, go for the more expensive brands.  If you're like me, and have to compromise for cost and time constraints, go for this Capresso.  I handle the problem by this compromise:  I load the bin to half.  When it's empty, I clean it quickly.  If it's the weekend, I clean it well.  I still get a morning espresso or capp that's better than 90% of the coffee shops in my town.  I use Caffe Appassionato organic espresso beans on Amazon's timed shipments for daily use, and buy the gourmet Italian for treats.
I have used this grinder daily for more than a year and have had no trouble with it.  I particularly like the easy storage of the beans so that in the morning I only have to turn a knob and wait less than a minute for perfectly ground coffee.  I noticed the difference in flavor from the steel-blade grinder immediately.  I love it.

Makes good coffee in less than a minute.
I can't really find any fault in the product, but I can tell you what I think would be better.
A larger water tank, we often have to fill it twice a day.  I wish I could attach a 5 gallon water bottle to it.  If such a device or add-on exists, let me know.
It's programmable, meaning you can set a timer to make that first cup of coffee in the morning, but it takes less than a minute to brew, so its an unused feature.
Hotter, you can set the temperature to a maximum of 192, but I like my coffee hotter than that, scalding hot.
Coffee runs you about 50 cents a cup.  If you're a heavy coffee drinker, maybe think twice about this device.  The coffee is very good and comparable to coffee shops, so it could be considred a discount price.  The tea's aren't bad either, Earl Grey, hot!
I purchased the reusable coffee filter, this is an ok device but I wouldn't recommend it; unless your drinking some wild blend that you can't do without, I find using this device more work than its worth.
I would buy this coffee maker again.

I only write this in hopes someone might have some suggestions.  I have used this coffee maker for 20 months and have had no problems.  I ran the self-cleaner yesterday and now it won't brew.  I checked everything I know to look at.  It just doesn't seem to want to pump the water thru or whatever.  Maybe a clog somewhere?  A note:  The filter is some sort of material not charcoal.  I just take it out and wash it out occasionally.  Thanks

I bought this juicer for my wife (and family) as a birthday gift.  We use it nearly every day now.  
Pros:  Really easy cleanup (we also use biodegradeable bags so we just toss the bag right into our composting bin), simple to use.
Cons:  Very tall - doesn't fit under our cabinetry in the kitchen.
All in all I'm very happy with the result.  I've told my wife that I'd like to try using it to chip brush from the yard as well...

This review is from: The Princess Bride (DVD)
      
I can remember back years ago when I was about 10 I first saw this movie while I was sick at home.  I know it seems a bit ironic (it matches the setting of the film pretty well).  This movie really moved me then, and it has left a mark that makes me still smile when I remenisce.The plot generally follows a medieval/fantasy love story, but it is masterfully integrated with touches of humor at all the right points.  Anyone with children between 7-12 should definately buy this DVD or otherwise try to get a hold of a copy of this movie.  This film is perfectly focused on kids at that age, it's humor subtly goes along with the childhood psychi.  Even adults will find themselves smiling at the interplay between the grandfather and the young sick-at-home child.  The humor only opens up the oppertunity for the true theme of eternal love to be accepted by the audience.All in all this is a memorable romp through a fantastical and touching world.  The humor allows for children of all ages (even grown-up children) to become immersed in story.  This movie also portrays a touching theme, that we can all gain something from.

What a truly amazing product this is!  I want to give them the Nobel Prize or something.  Here's how Feliway changed my life (and my kitties too!).
Jake and Elwood were from the same litter, and played well together for a few years.  My devious neighbor decides that it's okay to feed Jake...and then all of a sudden, Jake stops coming home (gee, wonder why)  I actually thought he might have been dead, since I hadn't seen him for months.(Both cats are outdoor, btw). When I finally did see him, I snatched him, and confined him to indoors for a while.  That's when all hell broke loose.  Jake and Elwood started hissing and fighting with each other, and I couldn't have them in the same room as each other.  Elwood freaked out over this "new" kitty, and started spraying every corner of the house... and he's neutered!  So both cats were completely unhappy.  Enter Feliway.
Within 2 hours of plugging this bad boy in....Jake and Elwood were mellow with each other, and stopped hissing.  After a full day, they were sleeping with each other and spooning.  Even cleaning each other's heads!   I can't even completely explain how magical this truly is.  I love this product.  I also bought the spray to wipe down the carrier before they go to the vet.  It's also just as miraculous!

I have tried every collar there is for my 2 1/2 year old Rottweiler.  She has three head collars, 2 harnesses, pinch collars, choker chains and regular nylon collars.  NOTHING works on her.  She has been through 4 months of obedience training and my husband and I have spent hours working with her and walking her daily.  We love to go hiking but, she had a bad habit of lunging at people and bikes.  Once she got worked up from seeing another hiker or biker, we could not seem to calm her back down.  She just became crazy in the head and hard to control.  It became so bad that we had to stop hiking because she scared other people and with her size, 112 pounds, it was really taking a toll on our shoulders trying to keep her under control.  She was never aggressive, not growling or biting, just lunging and hard to keep hold of.  Several times, she pulled me off my feet.  This collar has been a miracle for us.  She is a perfect little angel now.  She gets over and sits on command when a jogger or car goes by and if I sense she is going to jump, I give her the warning beep.  It only took about a week of using the "shock" before she got it and now we almost never have to use the stimulation.  The beep is all she needs now.  I must admit, the price kept me from buying it sooner but, I wish I would have got it a long time ago.  This is the solution for problem behavior.  I highly recommend this product and it has been the only thing that has worked for her.  It is so nice to have a well behaved dog.  All the training she went through made a difference too.  She had the knowledge, she just refused to obey until we had this collar.  It is worth the price.

This is my first pump-driven espresso machine, although I have had several small, steam-driven ones (they seem to last about 4 years, then quit). It is a little more complicated to use, but the result is more than worth the additional effort. I have been using it daily for about a month and a half, and I have no real complaints. I wish there were more space between the coffee holder and the deck, since I have to use a really shallow cup, but that is minor. The plentiful crema is a luxury, and the steamer works really well and quickly. If you don't want to spend hundreds (or thousands) more, but you want a pump-driven machine, I think this is a great solution.

I purchased this shaver a few months ago with some doubt that it would be worth it.  Needless to say, I have not picked up a razor in several months!!!!  My face is smooth everyday with a quick shave.  The auto cleaning system is easy to use and does a great job.  I have had the shaver for 5 months and only changed the cleaning solution one time.
Great shaver, buy it at a great price and you will not be disappointed.

I've had NetGear router and periodically, my laptop would not be able to establish wireless connection with the router. At this point, I'd  have no option but reboot the router. The problem would also appear if the laptop had prior connection with the office WIFI.
These problems have gone away after replacing the NetGear router with the Linksys. Network latency appears to have improved also.

I loved my previous Flip so much, I could not resist the impulse to buy it in HD.
This camcorder could not be any easier to use.  The personalization options make this thing even cooler!
The HD Mino is light, making it easy to carry around to capture important moments.  As opposed to my other camcorder, I find myself actually using the Flip.  
All you have to do it flip out the USB, plug it in (works great with Mac) and you can edit away with nifty software contained on the device itself.  The software is much better than the previous generation; easy to use, lots of cool features.  
The battery life is decent.  I find that I plug in the Flip frequently enough to download footage that it's rarely low on batteries.
The footage looks great, even in somewhat low light, although night filming was a little more problematic.  I found the sound quality crisp.  Distortion caused by breezes was surprisingly minimal.  You will not find better video quality for the money.  The autofocus works fantastically.
My only complaint is that the screen is on the small side.  I'd prefer to be able to see the benefits of the higher resolution on the device itself.   
A perfect present for the holidays in my opinion.

No more scooping. The cover cuts down on odor. We used it uncovered for a few days to get our two cats used to the new box. They had no problem with the cover thereafter. Some clean litter is deposited into the waste drawer when Omega Paw is rolled to remove the clumped waste. Perhaps a small design adjustment can correct that. Nevertheless, this is an excellent product.

The Omron HJ-7201ITC Pedometer is a wonderful product.  I bought one over a month ago and had to buy another one recently for my daughter.  It has helped me in my weight loss program.

This laptop is great. It is everything I expected. Ubuntu Remix works like a dream on it! Runs like regular Ubuntu but Remix has a nice little desktop with compact icons and transparent Windows ;) that run much better than Vista. I am glad I do not have to worry about spyware and viruses on this thing like Windows. Hey, Ubuntu is making Microsoft scared. That is why they are still rolling out Windows XP on these other netbooks you see! This machine is for the advanced computer user and people who just want to surf and be productive and can live without Windows apps. There are 100s of other Linux apps. that work just like Windows apps, so don't sweat it!

Set it up in 5 minutes and my iBook detected the router immediately, after turning on "Airport".  Didn't need to configure ANYTHING and is too easy to use, but maybe that's because I have a MACINTOSH ;&gt;)  
Only thing is, because I DO own a Mac, there is no mention of Mac-pertinent info on Linksys' website, so if you ever need support I don't know if you'll ever get it from them.  Especially troubling is no mention of firmware upgrades for Mac users, so in that aspect buyer (Mac user) beware.  Otherwise, this thing is working fine for me at the moment and as I mentioned earlier, installation for us Mac users is painless.

This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)
      
I was looking forward to New Moon, since I surprisingly enjoyed Twilight.  Meyer did a good job of moving the story along and not lagging behind in old news from the first.  Bella and Edward are still very much in love, but when Bella is attacked in Edward's own home by family members from a simple papercut, he decides if he loves her enough then he will let her go.
This novel transparently follows the Romeo and Juliet saga and even points it out to you in the book.  I didn't like that.  I don't like my authors to spell out the obvious to me.  Like Romeo and Juliet, there is a love triangle.  For Bella, that special other someone is Jacob.  Even though Jacob is two years younger, he is mature beyond his years, handsome, sweet, and head-over-heels in love with her.  Unfortunately, he's also a werewolf whose mortal enemy is vampires.
There is lots of action in the book.  Someone is hunting Bella.  Bella must rush to save Edmond, etc.
Overall, (regardless of the obvious remarks in writing) I thought it was thoroughly enjoyable and look forward to more.

I have a white Shih Tzu that came to me with tear stains all the way down into her "beard".  I tried wipes and topical liquids with no success.  The only outcome was she ran when I got close to her face.  I tried Angels Eyes supplement and by her next hair cut (about 3 weeks) her face was completely clean and stays that way with a teaspoon of product in her food each day. She's much happier now that I'm not messing with her eyes all the time and has quit flinching when I get near her face.  Good Job, Angels Eyes.

I moved up to this router from an older D-Link router- and added a new desktop computer with Windows VISTA at the same time.  Router set up and links to four other computers was made more complex by the D-Link supplied Network Magic software.  Until I removed Network Magic I had all kinds of connection problems, printing problems and the like.  With Network Magic gone, I am very happy with the D-Link router.  I don't know if the conflicts with Network Magic were due to mixed OS- (VISTA and XP) but it just didn't work.  Buy the router, skip Network Magic.

I've used various versions of Word and Excel for more than 15 years.  This version looks quite a bit different, especially in the menu bar.  But after a brief learning curve, the functionality is improved and I use fewer mouse clicks and keystrokes to get a menu item accomplished.
Several months ago I bought a Fujitsu ScanSnap S510 which is a great product.  I mention it here because Word and Excel both have specific menu functions related to Adobe Acrobat (a fully functional version comes with the ScanSnap).  The ability to create a pdf document from within Word or Excel with two mouse clicks is probably the feature I like best about this version of Microsoft Office.

This is exactly the device I was looking for: An external terrabyte hard drive that will play all kinds of media files, including DVD files &amp; high-def movies. This is an improved version over the previous Screenplay, in that the rear connections are better suited for home theater setups. The interface is also improved greatly in look and feel, with some new features, like a DVR/Tivo type of functionality which I have yet to try out. HD video looks amazing, although so far, I've only tried HD movie trailers downloaded from Apple's website. I haven't tried any Blu-Ray content yet as I don't have a Blu-ray drive. I also like the verticle format of the drive, which is small enough for any computer desk or entertainment stand. My only complaint so far is when you hit the "stop" button on the remote, it would be nice if it returned you back to the root level of the folder, rather than 2 folders deep. But that is a very minor complaint- not enough to take away a star. Great product!

Thank you Jillian!  I just did my first 20 minutes workout - level 1 of 3 level options - and I don't know if I can carry myself upstairs to bed!  Ha!  I'm even having trouble lifting my arms enough to type on the keyboard.  This is a dynamic, kick your butt into gear, workout and I KNOW I'm going to get results in no time with this DVD.  I just got back on a fitness kick late last fall after YEARS of getting fat and flabby.  I have been using a "Firm" Stability ball workout - which is great - but I wanted to try something different and I am so glad I picked Thirty Day Shred.  
First, I love the fact that there are three separate levels to this workout system.  I can start with level one and move on to two and then three when I'm ready.  They don't try to jam three levels into one workout.  Jillian gives you plenty of instruction along the way to make sure you are doing the exercises correctly.  Yea - a lot of the stuff is old school, but that's part of the reason it's easy to follow, no complicated dance movements here.  I'm not training for Broadway, after all.
I also love the fact I can get a dynamic workout in just 20 minutes a day.  I don't have a lot of time in my day and it's going to be so much easier to motivate myself to put the DVD in and move my butt when I know it's only 20 minutes. The intensity packed into that 20 minutes had me begging for mercy after 10 minutes! I'm going to be crying in pain tomorrow, but I'll be back at this workout tomorrow night because I know it's working.

WOW - I just received my FURminator (small blue one for a cat) and even after brushing her with a slicker brush this morning I now have a wad of fur 6" wide and 1" thick.  Granted this is a long haired cat with a thick undercoat but I brush her 5x a week - this is just incredible.  As long as I keep brushing with long, light strokes she loves it - even on her neck. Possibly the people who have problems are brushing too hard - I can see how that would irritate the animal's skin as the teeth of the furminator are heavy and sharp - not flexible at all.   Definitely 5 stars in my book!

After my old grinder stopped running and couldn't be repaired for less than the cost of the machine, I looked for the highest rated burr grinder under $100, and this was it (with Amazon's discounted price.)  My old one was messy and loud, and this one is really quiet for a grinder.  The plastic or acrylic that the hopper and ground coffee container are made of is less prone to static electricity than my other one, which makes the machine easier to keep clean.  And the coffee tastes better!  I agree with the other reviewers that say the grounds are more even and don't get as heated during grinding, which helps preserve the flavor.  
There are only a few things I would change to make this an even better product, including adding a switch mechanism that wouldn't let the machine start without the ground coffee container in place - that would prevent a terrible mess when you're in a hurry and not paying close enough attention.  I would also add an "off" switch to stop the machine if the timer was set for too long so you wouldn't have to change the grind setting to make the blades stop.

Wow, I'm so glad I didn't listen to all the one star reviews on here! 
I've been using Quicken on my PC forever. Love It. I switched over the a Mac recently and needed personal financial software. Of course I looked to Quicken. I could not believe all the negative reviews! Could it be true? Could Quicken really not work on my new Intuit-chip Mac?? I looked around for alternatives. Finding none I bought Quicken despite all the scary reviews. 
I followed the guidelines for switching my data from my PC (nothing more than making sure account names and categories were no longer than 15 characters). I backed up my old PC data, crossed my fingers, and hoped for the best. Seemless. Worked like a charm. Not a hitch. Not one. All my data transferred over. And yes, I'm able to download activity from my bank and credit card company into my accounts. The interface is very similar to the PC version and I find it quite intuitive.
So if you're hesitating over using Quicken on your Mac, don't!

Using this device as an access point only.  Connected to a D-Link DGL4100 Gaming Router.  Network of 3 PCs is wired with 1 laptop, also wired.  Before setup, I read about security, WEP v. WPA/WPA2-Personal and MAC address filtering. Security concerns were the reason for the wired network.  I used the CD to auto setup, and then manually configured after logging into the address my router assigned to the Access Point via DHCP (your router will change the default ip if you have it set to do so.  It's status page should tell you the new ip).
At first, I used simple WEP encryption.  Connection was quick.  Then I played with the WPA encryption.  Had problems connecting and stuck with WEP. I then disabled SSID broadcasting.  Tried again next day and realized after making changes to the AP's login page, and saving, you must EXIT the page before you can make a successful connection.  Once I figured that out, I went right to WPA2-Personal encryption (the highest level for me), and filtered by MAC address.  No problems.  Connects my Dell Latitude immediately and excellent range on the second floor as well (AP is on first floor).
Very satisfied.  Only complaint is the bright blue..wish it was all black to blend in more.  I plan on mounting it high on a wall in my basement stairwell, which will be a pretty central location in my house and will keep it out of sight.

I got richer results, but less volume, when using cream.

What I like about this gate:
It's wooden and more attractive than many of the metal or plastic gates I've seen.
It's sturdy. I have no qualms about using it at the top of my stairs.
It swings in both directions and can be swung against the wall when not in use to keep it out of the way.
It lifts out of the mounted brackets easily - which allows you to remove it when not in use (or when you need to move large furniture up your stairs!) 
Because it lifts out of the brackets, you can buy duplicate hardware and use this ONE gate in several locations around the house!
Cautions:
I've installed this gate 4 times. Good installation is key. Three of those times, the gate worked wonderfully! The fourth time, I was sloppy and the gate was not as secure, was harder to latch, and slipped out of the bottom bracket as others have described. Taking time to install properly is worth it. You may need to get longer screws or other wall anchors - depending on what material you will install it in.
I have found this exact gate sold in pet stores, too, but it is was cheaper when marketed for children.
If you use it for a dog, the wood is soft enough that quite a bit of chewing damage can be done.

If your kitchen space is limited like mine and you are looking for a versatile multitasking tool for blending and chopping look no further!
We originally got our smart stick to make baby food which it handled with ease. The blender works well and is the easiest attachment to clean. Our chopper has made LOTS of hummus - its the perfect size for one can of beans. I think I've only used the whisk once, and it worked just fine.
Performance wise, I'd give it 5 stars; clean up costs a star though. The blender is easy to clean, run it in some hot soapy water and rinse it off. Unfortunately The "gear" part of the chopper (which we use the most) must be hand washed between uses - the rest of the chopper is dishwasher safe though. 
 
I have NOT experienced any of the "quality control" issues other reviewers have griped about. We've used this handy smart stick blender a couple times a week for almost 2 years and its still going strong.
Bottom Line: Would I buy another one to replace it? You bet!

I never really thought about great coffee convenience, but this is it.  usually great coffee is burdened by grinding, brewing time and equipment- this is not- i wanted hotter coffee than our cuisinart and i got it- it isnt scalding but it is just right and i like hot coffee-dont let it sit for twenty minutes and expect it to be hot still, but you get the point.  Everyone i serve it to is amazed how simple and quick- i get to be the perfect host since i can get a decaf for so and so, a tea for whomever, and a strong one for uncle joe.  my husband and i share different tastes and this suits us perfectly.  a caveat- k cups/coffee not in supermarkets where i am from so on line ordering is a must- and storage is best accommodated by sacrificing a cabinet entirely (well, since i got just about every kind under the sun).  Coffee people brand and green mountain rival starbucks- which makes me very happy- so far i have not returned to starbucks brand and i pass tim hortons ( which i was starting to anyway with starbucks elevated taste buds) now cause i know i get the perfect cup at home.

This was really a great movie.  Usually when I bring my son to his movies, I just hope that it is entertaining enough that I can sit through it.  This movie had me glued to the screen the whole way through, and I am actually looking forward to buying it on dvd.  The tale is of a future earth that became so trash filled and polluted that mankind has left for the stars leaving behind the mess and a trash compacting robot whose only job is to try and clean up the mess.  Though he does have a roach for a friend, Wall-e is quite lonely and a bit eccentric after all those hundreds of years by himself.  When a probe robot is sent to earth to look for signs of returning life, Wall e finds himself falling in love.  Though there is minimal dialog, the actions of the robots speak much louder.  The animators really did a phenomenal giving such expression to Wall-e's robot face.  The whole movie really shines.  The short film with the magician and the rabbit was hysterical and a great kick off to the feature.  Reminded me of the classic Bugs Bunny shorts.  This is a can't miss.

This review is from: The Princess Bride (Special Edition) (DVD)
      
I'm a big fan of fantasy films from the 1980s, and after reviewing a couple here on amazon, this particular DVD came up. "Looks a bit girly," I thought, and so did my brother when he came over and spotted it on the coffee table. But for the most part "The Princess Bride", is actually fun for both boys and girls, and for viewers of all ages.
A boy (Fred Savage from "The Wonder Years") is sick in bed, so his Granpa (Peter Falk) comes to visit him. He's brought a book for them to read together called "The Princess Bride", a book that's been in the family for generations, and has always cheered the family up when they're sick. The boy is put off by the name, but decides to humour his grandpa and lets him read. His grandpa tells a tale of a peasant girl, Buttercup, (Robin Wright) who falls deeply in love with a farm boy named Westley (Cary Elwes), only to be heartbroken when he goes on a trip, apparently killed by pirates on the way. Buttercup vows never to love again, but these words don't stop the prince of Florin from taking her hand in marriage. Before the wedding, Buttercup is kidnapped by a Sicilian, then counter-kidnapped by a fear some "dread-pirate". But things are not as they appear, love that was thought to be dead is actually alive, and many an adventure and story are had, in this land full of monstrous eels, giant rats, fire-swamps, giants, six-fingered swordsmen and horrible instruments of torture.
Though there is a little bit of romance and melodrama in the film, it is a fairly light hearted piece. Everyone seems to be having a lot of fun. The score, which is mostly GM-like keyboard tones, by Mark Knopfler adds to the goofiness of things, though it is a tender track when it needs to be. The sets and costumes are pretty nice too, as is the character development. There's a couple of cameo appearances in the film as well, (like Billy Crystal as a "Miracle Worker") so keep an eye out.
Worth a look for fans of fantasy and of romantic comedy. Don't be put off by the title, it's a lot more than (as Fred Savage's character puts it) a "kissing story".

<review id="835" label="1">
I was a fan of Ron Moore and David Eick's reimagining of Battlestar Galactica, from the first few moments of the 3 hour pilot, back in December 2003. Their stated goal upon commencing production of the reimagining of Glen A Larson's 70's original was '...nothing less than the reinvention of the science fiction television series. We take as a given the idea of tradtional space opera - with it's stock characters, techno double talk, bumpy headed aliens, thespian histrionics and empty heroics has run it's course and a new approach is required...'
  Their aim was to introduce realism into an aggressively unrealistic genre. Well I'm here to tell you - gentle Amazon shoppers - that they have achieved just that!! If you've not seen the pilot miniseries of this new Galactica then buy it immediately, watch the 3 hour epic that begins the show then all 13 suspenseful and masterly acted episodes, then buy this Season 2.0 - the first 10 episodes from the 20 or so run of Season 2. 
  I am a drama purist, I admit it, so I don't believe in preaching to the initiated. Those of you reading this review who're familiar with Season 1 of the reimagined Battlestar will know of the show's high calibre production values and stellar acting from one of the best ensemble casts ever assembled on ANY drama, let alone Sci-Fi. To the uninitiated I will simply advise this: If Star Trek and it's 4 spin-off shows were your idea of 'realistic' sci-fi visions of mankind's future in space, then the new Galactica probably won't appeal to you. But if you like to think of yourself as a more cerebral viewer - who likes to be challenged and absorbed by your drama entertainment - then I can't recommend this show highly enough. It is adult entertainment - tackling real human issues in an often allegorical fashion. It's dark, sexy, edge of the seat stuff that pays (in this humble reviewer's opinion) sufficient homage to it's predecessor.
  Season 2.0 Boxset contains three beautifully presented slimline dvd cases with 10 Episodes between them, continuing where Season 1 left of - culminating with Pegasus, which is a two part mid-season cliffhanger that had be gagging for more. I can't wait for Universal to release Season 2.1.
  Do yourself a favour and get both Season 1 and 2.0 boxsets today. You won't regret it - I promise.

I just bought this mixer after 5 years of wanting one and never being able to find one on sale.  Somehow I lucked out and stumbled upon it on Amazon last week for $250!  I couldn't pass up that deal and as you can see, it was a very shortlived one.  I probably would have chosen Red if I were paying full price, but only Licorice was on sale, and I have to say it's very pretty and looks great in my kitchen.  I don't make a lot of bread normally because I hate kneading, but this thing kneaded pizza dough for 2 large pizzas in less than a minute.  I was amazed.  I'm sure it's capable of much more, but that is all I've had time to try with it.  Anyways, this product is well worth my 5 year wait for a good deal and I can't wait to make all sorts of whole grain breads, pizzas, and pastas.  This mixer is more than worth its hefty price tag if you make large batches of things.  The motor is huge and could be heavy for some, but with the bowl raising mechanism, you can use it right under your cabinets and not worry about moving it around too much.  I'm very happy with my purchase and look forward to using it for years to come.

I purchased a HoMedics SS-2000 Sound SPA for a friend who was having trouble sleeping in a large apartment complex due to outside noise.  The SPA did the trick!  She has had many nights of uninterrupted sleep and has fallen in love with this product.  You don't need to spend a fortune to get a good product!

The Breville Juicer is without a doubt the best juicer out with it's powerful motor &amp; sleek engineering!  I would suggest this juicer to anyone.  There really isnt anything bad I can say about it except that is it rather large, but at the same time it is so handsome....who cares.   It looks expensive, which it is!!  Also, it is the conversation piece of my kitchen.  Everyone who enters walks straight up to it and has to touch it!!  It is a step up from any juicer you are use to.  If your serious about juicing....It is worth the money!!!!

This review is from: The Secret Life of Bees [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)
      
Two of us went to this movie last night. It was the first show on the release day and there were only six others in the whole movie theater. However, that fact was not indicative of the movie's worth.
It was a very moving, yet joyful movie, set in the backdrop of racial tensions and violence of 1964 in South Carolina. Fourteen year old Lily (Dakota Fanning) flees her abusive father along with her caregiver Rosaleen (Jennifer Hudson) who is battered for claiming her rights as a colored woman.  Lily is also fleeing from her fussy and haunting memories of accidentally shooting her mother to death, during an abusive tussle between the couple. Guided by a honey bottle label they reach the Boatwright sisters. August (Queen Latifah) the oldest among the Boatwrights welcomes the fugitives. They put them to work in the mesmerizing world of bee keeping. Lily grows in loving admiration for the maternal figure of August and learns more about her own mother and her deep love for Lily. 
Dakota Fanning does a superb job of portraying the abused, at the same time, assertive Lily of fourteen years. All the other cast members do justice to their roles, though Queen Latifah, as a caring maternal figure to Lily and queen of the Boatwright beehive, is less convincing.  Overall, the movie tastes sweet in the mouth, but leaves a lump in the throat.  It's sure to appeal more to female audiences. Apparently that's what the ad is calling for: "Bring your girlfriends, sisters, mothers and daughters."

Hi All.
So we are quite a large family with 3 kids that all want their own laptops.  What to do?  Netbooks are my answer.  I have already purchased and reviewed a Lenovo S10 with Windows 7 and now I bought this unit and upgraded it to 2gb ram with Windows 7.
You may be wondering if I loved the S10 then why did I try the HP...simple...I bought it at a liquidation sale and $$$ were the only thing on my mind.  I got it for less then $400 with the 2gb upgrade.
I must say that I am equally impressed with this laptop.  The 2gb upgrade was a breeze and installing windows 7 from a USB stick was also very very easy.  Please google the windows 7 via usb stick method, it will save you from having to buy a dvd/cd drive and it works perfectly via a 4gb Sandisk Cruzer.  
The box comes with the laptop, the battery, and ac-adapter.  The machine comes with 1gb RAM and only has 1 slot...so if you upgrade to a 2gb SO-DIMM then you are going to lose the 1gb it includes..it gets put on the side - just in case.  :-)
You may be wondering why I chose a beta operating system.  Well, my opinion is that XP is dated, Vista is a Beast, and Windows 7 is a breath of fresh air.  Yes Windows 7 is a BETA....and wont be released any time soon (or so they say)...but it has great power management features that work perfectly on a netbook.  This machine scored a whopping 3.5 out of 5.5 on the ratings panel..and I believe the low score is due to the Atom processor being 1.6.  The memory, hard drive, video, etc was all around the 5 mark....  For those that dont know...windows vista and windows 7 have a hardware rating that they give to all machines....
This particular unit is for my 11 year old son in 6th grade.  He wants something that he can play online games with, do homework with, and check the schools website for study guides etc....  Simple stuff.  
I have loaded Office 2007 on the system and it works without a flaw.  Speed is not an issue and sometimes I wonder if it is necessary to spend thousands of dollars on a high powered machine like I have done with my Thinkpad...  Yes the screen is 10"...that is my only issue thus far..but you can get used to it, for once you pick this thing up and say "MAN this is LITE...."  :-)  We have used Microsoft Word and Excel regularly no issues.
Wireless performance is perfect...no dropouts and no issues getting connected.
Windows 7 found all of the drivers for this laptop, which I must say is amazing....and really helpful.  No fiddling around with trying to find latest and greatest drivers...it just works.  Windows 7 also has great power savings features for these machines....ie the hibernation which I have never had 100% success with....well 7 makes it work.  On a netbook when you close the lid the machine hibernates...press the power and it resumes to where you left off.
I can keep going on and on.....
Others have complained about some proprietary HP stuff...but I have one question to all that buy a Netbook.....what are you trying to achieve?
If you need a laptop that can handle all basic and some advanced functions and you dont care about having a plethora of connections (ie. more then 2 usb ports) then this machine is for you.  If you need a lot of connectors and bells and whistles...buy a full size machine.
The only gripe I have..and its not major...is that the headphone and microphone are on the same jack.....which is easily overcome buy using a usb based headset...  
Thats it....I hope you like my review.

I had my baby for 3 hours now and I must say it's a dream to type on, the mouse pad is good too. My Eee also booted up quickly and I was able to access the internet fast.  I scooted around many websites in a flash. The only problem I see with this little guy is that I can't watch Hulu videos without it constantly starting and stopping and my volume is very, very low.  I checked the volume on the computer and everything is set to the highest levels. I also tried to watch an instant netflix movie and it said that my connection was too slow and that I could watch it in one hour and twenty minutes. Other than not being able to watch TV or videos I think this is a great little computer and I recommend anyone looking for a netbook to seriously consider this one.

Observando el tamano, la calidad de imagen y el desempeno no queda mas que aceptar que estamos frente a un gran producto, el teclado es bastante grande y se puede utilizar con la facilidad acostumbrada en otros mucho mas grandes, la resolucion de la pantalla y su resolucion son excelentes, muy facil de acceder a redes inalambricas a traves de wifi y sincronizar mi Nokia N95 con su bluetooth, aunque algunas cosas deben ser dichas para ser objetivo... se calienta bastante en la parte inferior, (tal vez es por ser enteramente de cubiertas externas metalicas) y lo otro es el sistema operativo... Windows Vista Business... Estoy esperando un poco mas para  migrar el equipo a windows xp, pero en lineas generales les recomiendo este equipo, muy eficiente al contar con su tamano y portabilidad.

We took this to the Dr's office and checked it against thier automatic blood presure cuff and it is within 2 mg of the same numbers.  Even taking your own more than once on the same arm will give that difference. We are very happy with the product. It would be nice if it's face was a bit smaller and or had a 'smoother' less angular design.

Saitek has always made good hardware, and the X52 was no exception. I briefly owned its predecessor, the X36, years ago, but returned it when I couldn't get the drivers to work (this was under Win98, mind you), but the feel of that hefty, chunky design stuck with me. When I found out about the X52 I just had to give it another go (having already bought and been quite satisfied with a Cyborg Evo), and I was not disappointed. 
Since the grip on the main stick is adjustable, even my wimpy hand fits comfortably despite the sheer size of the design. Control is smooth, with perfectly tuned resistance that does not hang when centered. The throttle is adjustable; on the lowest setting it glides smoothly while on the highest it takes a fair bit of push to move. The primary and pinkie triggers are both solid metal and feel like they could take some serious abuse; the toggles on the base also feel solid. The flip cover over the primary fire button just feels awesome and is a huge improvement over the flip-down button of earlier models in this line.
The programming software included with the package is extremely useful; it allows you to create separate profiles for every game you play, changing button functions and even allowing you to switch which axis is which ( very handy, since not every game recognizes them the same way; just going with default settings I found that some games would actually recognize the slider and knob controls as the rudder or roll controls and not let me change them). Since I got the X52, I haven't had to mess around rebinding key commands to joystick buttons at all, which used to be a huge annoyance when reinstalling- now all I have to do is copy over my profiles and I'm set to go.
I only have a few complaints about this stick:
-The C button, located on the left side of the stick, is easy to press by accident due to its position and does not feel as durable as the rest of the controls.
-The drivers provided on the CD are THE ONLY ones that work for me; every time I've downloaded new drivers from the Saitek website they have screwed up everything and made necessary a complete wipe and reinstallation of the SST software.
-Some older games won't recognize the stick. To be honest, I've only had this problem with a handful of games, and they're all *really* old (Win95/98 old), but the problem does exist and the SST software can't compensate for it.
Nonetheless, the few issues I have had do not detract from the quality of the product or my satisfaction; this is the best of its breed and it will take something truly impressive to surpass it. Because the price is so much lower now than it was when I bought mine, I'd recommend this version of the X52 over the newer X52 Pro model- the improvements to the new design are marginal and not really worth the extra $40-$50 unless you absolutely have to be on the cutting edge.

Before purchasing the Omron HJ-112, I bought a different brand, that cost more money, at a local sporting goods store. It was a piece of junk. It often was off by 50%. I did some research and settled on the HJ-112. It's fantastic. I verify accuracy about 3 times a week by counting 200 steps and checking the pedometer. With rare exception, the pedometer counts 200 steps. When it is off, it counts 199 or 201, which probaby means that I miscounted. I highly recommend this product.

I bought this DVD as soon as it was available, as we used the first DVD in this series "My Baby Can Talk-First Signs."  Caitlin was about 14 months when she saw the Sharing Signs DVD, and made the sign for diaper the next day after viewing the DVD.
My husband thought I was nuts, trying to teach Caitlin sign language, but he is a believer now.  We showed her the first video a few times a week starting at around 9 months, and she made her first sign around 11 or 12 months.  She has not learned ALL of the signs on these videos yet.  She tends to make the signs that mean the most to her, like book, milk, diaper, baby, and hat.  It is so cute to see her sign, and she is happy when we praise her.  Right now she is labelling things rather than asking for them with signs, most of the time, but she made the sign for book the other day and headed off to her bedroom to get out her books for me to read to her.  I don't think she is making genius progress with the signs, but she is learning words, and what things are, which is really neat and will give her a leg up, I think.  Even if you are not interested in the signs, the videos show the word on the screen, say the word, show the sign, and then show lots of examples of that word.  Caitlin just loooooves to watch these videos, and an added bonus is that she will eat almost anything while they are on.  We really have enjoyed learning sign language with her, and I think it has been a useful communication tool.  We are so tickled when she does a new sign.  She is about 15 months now, and did the signs for lion and monkey for the first time today.  Yay, Caitlin !

i just got this to use for my n64 emulator on my pc.  overall, it's a great deal.  it's not going to be nearly as nice as one that costs more (there aren't analog sticks, for example), but it works well.  the shoulder buttons (similar to the r and l buttons on a ps2 controller) feel kinda weird, but with a little experience the feeling becomes less distracting.  inexpensive controllers with analog sticks typically break more easily, so this is a great budget gamepad.  i have only had it for a few days so i cannot vouch for its long-term reliability, but as with any product, if you treat it well, it will last longer.

I recently purchased this mini food processor to replace a 25 year old "Cuisinart Pro" that gave up the ghost after some serious use.  While, I don't know if this one will last another 25 years it does look like a smaller version of my original.  The design and manufacturing seems identical and the results are the same regardless of capacity. If I remember correctly the "Pro" cost over $200; more than four times the current price of the smaller model.
I just want to add a note of advice to would be buyers of this appliance or any other food processor....What these things do well is puree ingredients into sauce bases, tapenades, soups, salsas and the like.  Don't buy one expecting to throw away the paring or chef knives.  If you are preparing large quantities of sliced vegetables you're better off with a mandolin or a good set of knives.  I've always found the attachments to be generally more trouble than they're worth.  But for a small preparation of the aforementioned foods, I don't think you can beat the Cusinart Handy Prep.

I cuurently use a Sanddisk Cruzer 1.0 Gb flash drive to move my Quickbooks program from home to work and back. It is a very large file - 79 Mb's with many tens of thousands of transactions. 
I can't tell you what the data transfer rate of the cruzer 1.0 is, but it is so slow that it makes the program impossible to use. It takes three to four seconds to record one transaction! As a workaround, I  have to download the entire file to my hard drive, do my postings, and then re-save it to the flash drive.
A 256 Mb flash drive that I had earlier, and whose name I failed to make note of, worked many times faster than the Cruzer, which is why I am so sensitive to the speed.
In researching to find a faster drive, I find that only Kingston and Memorex post their data transfer rates under technical data. The rest seem to think that "Modern slim design" is a technical feature.
I have ordered the Kingston Data Traveler as its transfer rates are 6.0 mb read, and 3.0 mb write. I really don't know if this is fast or slow, but in the absence of all the other brands leaving out this information, I am going to assume it is fast, and hope for the best.

I have made my husband the happiest man alive when I turned his boring breakfast cereal eating days into an exciting breakfast experience! One thing run toasting cycle first before you toast anything or you will get a weird plastic smell. The smell wears of after the first toasting cycle.
#1 it cooks egg Mcmuffins to perfection
#2 clean up is sooooo easy
#3 it offers a variety of other dishes to be made!
So what if the meat from heating tray drips off onto the food. I am a cook and know that this gives it much more flavor! If you are concerned just pat the poached egg with a paper towel (easy).
Recipes I have come up with:
1. Try havarti cheese instead of cheddar and put some steamed spinach on top of the egg, yummy, use with English muffin or croissant.
2. Try smoked turkey breast deli slices for lower fat, cheddar cheese and spread raspberry jam on the bottom of the English muffin.
3. Try Cheese whiz over an opened faced English muffin instead of hollandaise sauce.
4. Try an opened faced egg sandwich, use cheddar cheese, sausage patty and poached egg 
and pour sausage gravy over top.
If you want a low fat cheese try a soy pepper jack found at Giant. MMM much lower fat! 
The recipes are endless!!!!!!!!!! And much easier and cleaner too!!!

I recently ate at a local Japanese Hibachi Bar and I was more amazed by how sharp the knives that the chefs were using than the tricks that they performed as they cooked my meal. I said, man I gotta get a set of knives like that!
A few years ago I bought a new set of knives from Amazon (J.A. Henckels Twin Signature 7-Piece Knife Block Set). The problem with this excellent set of knives is that the sharpener that came with it is one of those steel wands. A Master Chef can clank that wand back and forth against the blades of his knives with great precision to create a razor sharp cutting tool. I, on the other hand, somehow seem to have made the blades of my knife set duller using the dog-gone wand. 
So sitting there at the Hibachi bar I had an epiphany! A voice! It called out in my head...."Buy a better knife sharpener."
Where better to look than the place that I bought my knives: Amazon. Type in: Knife sharpener. Lo and behold: dozens of choices of knife sharpeners!!! Woo-hoo! The Presto Pro EverSharp Electric Knife Sharpener has a lot of high ratings; it's inexpensive...give it a try.
Try I did, and the knives in my set are now sharper than they were when they arrived new! The Presto Pro is pretty cool: a 4-slot little machine that looks like a mini-toaster. Turn it on. To sharpen: apply very little pressure...run your blade 3 times through both slots on the left side of the toaster...er...I mean...sharpener; to hone: again...not too much pressure...run your blade 3 times through both slots on the right side of the sharpener. And voil�! You're cutting through meat and veggies like a Master Hibachi Chef!
Great little product. Stop reading my goofy review and add it to your cart.

I ordered one of these boxes just before Christmas since I hate cleaning the litter box and this seemed like it would make the job much easier for me.  I had read the reviews and it seemed that the majority were good so I decided to try it out.  I was amazed at how quickly it arrived.  I immediately opened it and put it together.  I did have a little trouble with the clips, as mentioned in other posts, but it wasn't a big deal for me.  My 2 cats were wary of using it at first.  I already had one covered box and one uncovered box so I didn't think having the cover on would deter them, but they steered clear of it that first day so I took the top off until I saw it had been used.  I put the top back on the next day and they've been using it ever since.  I love how easy it is to use.  I got to the point that I hated having to scoop my other box when this one was so easy to do, so last week I ordered another one and now I can clean both boxes in less time than it used to take to clean one.   I use World's Best Cat Litter and have had no problems.  I had read some of the reviews that mentioned the poo sticking to the grill, so I just make sure that I don't clean the box right after they have used it.  My cats don't cover theirs, but the litter seems to draw out the moisture quickly so it has hardened by the time I empty the box.  So far I haven't had any trouble with anything sticking to the grill.  My husband always used to complain about the smell from the litter boxes and since I've been using this one we haven't noticed a smell at all.  That is probably due to the fact that I am actually cleaning it every day so it never has much in it.  In the past I would put it off thinking I didn't have time right then to do it.  Now, I just clean it when I get home from work and it's done in less than a minute!  I highly recommend this box.  The little bit of litter that may spill when you are turning it is nothing compared to the litter the cats used to kick out of the other litter boxes I had.  And because it is covered I don't find little "presents" on the floor where the cat missed the box while doing her business.  I've been looking for the "perfect" litter box for years, and I think this one fits the bill.

this thing is really nice, its great with the camera to use skype,  its not even that small, once your used to it you dont even realize it is all you need, i use it in class where it is convenient on a small desk and really light to carry around like a small book.  The proccessor rocks too, comfortable to use standing or sitting and its really non abtrusive.
Everyone is really jelouse of it, because it does everything 1000$ laps do,   this is a true laptop,  i got a silicon cover for the keyboard which is great, and i got skins off ebay for graphics, and a 20 dollar protective hard case all of ebay, this machine is true

I have been having problems shaving ever since I joined the Navy at age 18. Having course, curly facial hair, I constantly had to deal with painful ingrown hairs and irritation.  So, over the next 12 years, I ended up tried just about everything from top of the line Disposables, expensive safety and straight razors and even laser hair removal. But nothing seemed to work.
I have also had my share of electric shavers and clippers. Over the years, I've grown disappointed with the quality of electric shaves. They either didn't cut all of the hair, which lead to ingrown hairs or really irritated my face, which lead to ingrown hairs :(
After reading the reviews about the PocketGo p-70 and after seeing the price of it, I'd figured that I would give it a shot.
Much to my surprise, this little, inexpensive shaver gives me the best shave that I ever had. Granted, I had to train my face, such as removing all of the current ingrown hairs that I had and using a facial scrub to help remove all of the harden skin, from razor shaving, off of my face. Note: being that my facial skin was hard, my facial hair difficulty breaking the surface and with either lay flat against my face or curl back under. I also used a electric eyebrow shaver to the trim the hairs that were too long for the razor to cut. After doing this for about a week, my face has completely cleared up and with no signs of irritation. I use the razor, as my primary shaver, everyday and would highly, highly recommend it.

My son was very strong and very active from birth. No average swaddle could hold him. It was impossible to keep him still long enough to swaddle him with plain blankets. My sister in law sent me these swaddles when her daughter outgrew them. Second generation and they lasted well enough for me to pass them on again! Hats off to the designer! A must buy for all baby shower gifts.

I don't know why I got rid of the last model of yogurt maker, we were remodeling the kitchen, and I thought I did not need the Salton Yogurt maker.
I was wrong.
I started making yogurt using a quart canning jar and the microwave convection oven as a heat source. I have a microwave convection oven which can be set at 100 degrees F. I used it to make the yogurt. Worked great except the microwave oven was tied up while the yogurt was being made. Also, the constant noise from the microwave convection oven drove me crazy.
It's so much quieter to use the Salton yogurt maker. It quietly sits on the counter keeping the yogurt mixture gently warmed and about 6 to 10 hours later you will have a quart of homemade, preservative free, yogurt. Yummy!
I use the enclosed recipe which calls for plain yogurt, dried milk, and fresh milk. You can use dried or evaporated milk too, if you choose. 
What I do is make up a batch of Nido whole milk using the milk powder sold at Amazon. You also need to use plain yogurt with active cultures. Pick a brand of yogurt you like as the flavor of your homemade yogurt will closely resemble the plain yogurt purchased as the starter. Follow the recipe directions which include heating the milk, allowing it to cool, and then adding the yogurt starter. Place the container in the yogurt maker, place the lid on the yogurt, and about 6 to 8 hours later you have yogurt.
Very easy, very tasty. 
You can later make yogurt cheese by using a small strainer or by purchasing a yogurt cheese maker sold at Amazon. Yogurt cheese is thick, rich and delicious. You can spice it up with garlic and herbs or make a sweet cheese. Your preference.
I am glad to have the Salton Yogurt maker back in action in my kitchen. It was missed.

The Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box was everything it promised. Just roll the litter pan over, the loose clean litter falls into the grate, the clumping dirty litter rolls over the crate onto the outside panel. When you roll the litter box back up right, the clumps of dirty litter and waste fall into the slide out tray.  Remove the tray by the handle, dump contents into the trash and replace. The clean litter falls back through the grate and Kitty has a clean litter the use. The entire process only takes a minute. Really! I only have one cat, so once every two weeks I unsnap the lid and empty the entire contents into the trash, spray the inside out with water and replace with new litter. You never have to pickup a scratched litter bag again. I have recommended it to all my friends.

I asked for this for christmas after thinking spur of the moment I wanted a bread machine, I read some reviews and then went for it.
I love it. The first loaf was perfect. I have been making the basic sandwich with weat, white, walnut and a few other recipies that come with the machine. They have all been perfect and it takes about 10 minutes to measure and place ingredients in machine. The timer works great, I wake up to fresh bread.  Cleaning is so quick, it is quiet and easy to use.  It is tall, so if you have smaller cabniets you might need to measure. But it is light.  If I had known making bread was so easy, I would have gotten one a long time ago.  I look forward to trying more recipies.

I want to give this a 5* review, but there are a few very minor faults I have noticed in the past 10 hrs or so, so I think it deserves a 4.5... unfortunately Amazon doesn't allow that, so I'll hafta settle for a 4....  This review is based on  a machine with the 2 GB RAM upgrade.
Pros:
Love the multitouch for the most part... dunno how humans have lived without that for so long...
Very small compared to laptops (and obviously desktops).
Looks snazzy.
Great screen... works fine outdoors (although it wasn't particularly sunny out).
Very long-lasting, fast-charging battery (7.5 hr battery life for me with wireless/bluetooth turned off)  Charged out of the box to full charge in 55 minutes.
Plays basic video games at the very least(ie PopCap games) flawlessly even when not in high performance mode.
Networking is a breeze... fast wireless... and BLUETOOTH.
Runs office programs, browsers, divx movies (fullscreen too), youtube fullscreen (not so much with HD), and lots of other stuff very smoothly.
Upgrades for ram/hdd are very easy.
Nice comfortable-sized keyboard (I have average-sized man-hands), with a good layout.
Windows XP! And a disc containing XP!  Holy crap! Unheard of...
Great price.
Faster than my desktop (heh)...
Cons:
Spacebar gives very little feedback/very sensitive, and sometimes seems to get stuck (or it could just be that I leave my finger on it without realizing, because of the lack of feedback.)
Mouse buttons somewhat hard  to click, but multi-touch interface makes up for it big time.
Can't really get the hang of zooming in/out with multi-touch... im sure I'll get it down, but right now it seems to work only about 50% of the time... everything else about multitouch is excellent though.
No CD Rom drive (but I already knew this, and so do you, most likely)-- I don't think this is a big deal though... pretty sure you could just use a program like poweriso or something like that, along with a large USB flash drive (assuming you have another computer).
Online streaming audio tends to click a bit... MP3s, and the audio from my AVI movies and video games are perfect though.
Fingerprint magnet.
All in all, a great purchase!  I could see myself using this thing more than my main computer.  I love it.  Its totally worth it, so just buy it!  I would have paid 70-100 bucks more if I'd had the chance to give it a test-drive first.

As a few people have already confirmed this is the 16 MB memory model that you can put custom firmware on.  I can't say much about the original Linksys firmware because it only "lasted" about an hour until I uploaded dd-wrt.

I am specifically commenting on the latest Logitech Dual Action design. This improved pad, which is now widely available at retail and distinguished from its flawed predecessor by a new "shift" key with a red LED, is nearly perfect as a reasonably priced PC analog pad. I have used it heavily for over a year now with NO degradation in the analog switch sensitivity. Both sticks have a higher quality "feel" right out of the box. Perhaps I could wish for analog triggers or a more robust feeling D-pad, but not too much should be expected from a $20 controller. 
A few other users appear to be confused over the pad's compatibility. A PC game does not need to find this constroller compatible for it to be useful. The wonderful Logitech Profiler software, while a bit unwieldly when creating button assignments, emulates keyboard input as a background program while playing the game. The only game (out of hundreds I've tried) that blocked the Profiler software was Red Faction. No it's not quite as easy as the plug-n-play nature of console peripherals, but PC gaming is always a little more tricky. For $20, it's a great buy for the action/sports/shooter fan.
I want to emphasize that this review ONLY covers the most recent model, and not the older design that  didnt have a shift key. That model used really cheap analog switches that deteriorate quickly.

New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2)
I first read Twilight in Hungarian. New Moon will only be released in Hungarian at April 2009, and I was so fascinated by the story that I could not wait until it arrives... :))) So I ordered immediately the whole serie from Amazon.com.
I fell irrevocably and unconditionally in love with that really true love story. Not only it gave me a great practice in my English, but I was amazed how genious Stephenie Meyer was to give a wholly new aspect to the well-known vampire tales: placing it in our modern world. Like your neighbour could be a vampire, and you didn't even know about it... Seeing true love's victory over all troubles... I will always be fond of it. New Moon goes even deeper in that world. Thanks, Stephenie! :)))

This review is from: Pinocchio (Disney Gold Classic Collection) (DVD)
      
The one-two whammy of audience and critical indifference to "Pinocchio" and "Fantasia" killed Walt Disney's desire to experiment with the limits of animation in the 1940s. From then on, play it safe was his motto. This may be one of the greatest tragedies to beset popular American culture in the 20th century; despite the depths of pretension and kitch in "Fantasia," it was at least evidence of a spirited mind in pursuit of the unattained -- but "Pinocchio" must have broken old Walt's heart. There are visual effects in this movie that remained unchallenged until the digital age, and it's worth recalling that every single one of them was drawn by hand. It has one of the most beautiful and exciting musical scores in the history of the movies (I can't hear Cliff Edwards' high, pure falsetto holding that final note of "When You Wish Upon a Star" without chills), a deeply plangent sense of emotion that never tips over into bathos, and a wealth of detail that is still staggering after 65 years. But it may be too dark a movie to attain the popularity of more cheerful Disney cartoons like "Snow White" -- although even that one can frighten the tots. Now: where is the double-disc Special Platinum Edition???

I was just about jaded with all these new HD cameras, when I ran into this by accident, scanning through Google.
I had purchased an Kodak Easyshare M1033, then a Zi6, they both failed miserably at even coming close to Standard definition, let alone high definition. They had alot of motion artifact, alot of graininess at any light exposure, and were useless in the dark. They went to new owners.
I had about given up until I saw this when perusing products at 2009 CES. I have had it one day, but it surpasses the products that I have used and that are out there.
First off, images are clear, for real, not grainy. It actually has 4 different light settings - sports, landscape, backlight, and lowlight. None of the other 'pocket cameras' have this. This is extremely important, or you can forget recording video in your home.
Secondly, it has an led light that can be utilized to record in the dark...what a great idea!!! It maximizes battery life, and extends your video range. Amazing difference.
Next, it has a real optical zoom, not some fake digital zoom. At whats more, when you zoom, it doesnt blurr, like the Nikon and Kodak video footage I have seen and made. Another gigantic leap.
It has all necessary connectivity, component cables, usb, and it is very intuitive to use. After about 30 minutes with it, you can film your own documentary. But even in simple terms, once the clock is set you can start filming immediately. Just change from sports setting to another light setting before you start, or you will see a black screen indoors. Oh, and, take the lens cap off.
Ok, memory, it has 12mb onboard, which will get you a few pics, and 15 seconds of HD video. Yeah, eh...But it does have a pro duo slot. I was certainly not excited about this, I have alot of SD cards lying around. But I looked for a good deal, and dealt with it. Video compression is nice, and you get about 1 sec per MB, or about 140 min with an 8gb card. This is actually better than the kodak compression, as far as storage.
Also, videos are simple to use. Simple to play on a computer, just plug in the usb, you dont need a pro duo slot on your pc. I uploaded easily to Youtube, and also played them nicely on my 42" big screen. Another plus, it runs through all the videos with one click. Some folks may not like this, but I dont like to click on all 40 videos I recorded, just play em all, and skip if you want. Otherwise, you would be sitting by the tv changing them the whole time, while everyone else enjoys. Nice idea, Sony.
Sony thought of other nice things as well, including wrist strap, concise packaging, lens cap strap, and nice charging setup. Leave those AAs at home Kodak Zi6. It even takes pictures!
Take it from me, the Webbie does much more than anything else out there in the $150-$400. If you are going to spend $200 anyway, why not get a serious camera that blows away the competition. You wont be disappointed. This will be the camera everyone has within 3 months.

This is the best wheel I've used. Its really nice. If your looking for a wheel you should really consisder this one. I use it for my PS3 and it works perfectly. The only downside is that it doesnt have a PS button so you will need your controller to exit the game or turn off your PS3. I would also suggest you dont buy it from Tigerdirect or Compusa. Its where I got mine and it was used. I have read many reviews saying the wheel in bad shape but I just bought it from them anyways. Overall this is the best wheel, just buy it from a trusted seller.

As long as I moisten the chest strap, this reliably reports my heart rate.  I checked it by comparing with gym machines that detect my pulse from handlebars.   Most gym machines will also pick up the signal from the chest strap, so the watch receiver isn't necessary in that place.  Some of the gym machines will display random glitches even when nobody else is nearby and the wrist receiver shows a believable pulse.
The main problem is that the watchband is stiff.  With my narrow wrists, it won't lie flat against the wrist near the buckle.  It's not uncomfortable, it just doesn't fit right.

I love the Acer; I've had no wireless problems, the keyboard is just big enough to be completely useable, and the screen is even surprisingly useable.  The installed OS is quite sufficient for most uses, but not quite enough for mine --- if they'd bundled a better email client (specifically support for s/mime and pgp, which most people don't use, but should), and a remote desktop and pptp client into it, I could have stuck with it, but I gave up and installed ubuntu 8.04.  I give up properly card slot handling, but a usb card reader is effectively as convenient, and the card slot handling will probably be fixed in the upcoming release aimed at subnotebooks.  I also got a Logitech V220 mouse to avoid the awkward mousepad buttons.  The v220 self-stores the usb dongle and is quite convenient.
Another complaint is having to disassemble the thing to add memory.  It has a sodimm slot on the backside of the motherboard, but no cover on the bottom of the case that would provide easy access trivially.  Go figure.  Fortunately, linux is lightweight enough it's not really needed.
Also: no bluetooth, which would be nice to enable a dongle-less mouse and a headset for voip chatting, but is far from a requirement.
And finally, it would be nice if they built in whole disk encryption too --- with the frequency of laptop thefts, that should be a defacto standard.  I can't fault them for not doing what no one else is doing, but it needs to be said.
So to sum it up: it's a nearly perfect lightweight laptop with these minor weaknesses:
1.  lacking email and disk encryption/vpn/remote desktop software
2.  awkward mousepad buttons
3.  memory upgrade access
4.  missing bluetooth

I love nature shows and I really appreciate learning about the planet, but I could really do without all the global warming junk that is constantly infiltrating more and more of these programs. There is no such thing as man-made global warming! The earth experiences natural cycles of warming and cooling all the time. The sun is by far the largest contributer to weather patterns and not how much I drive my car around town or if the industry down the street is operating or not. There are much more important concerns for humanity to be concerned with such as the over 50 million babies that have been murdered in the United States alone since Roe Vs. Wade. I think that's a bit more important than anything.

This camcorder is simply great. Small, excellent video quality, and an extremely convenient storage. Like many other costumers, I was divided between the HF100 and HF10 models, but here is a definitive difference that, after two moths, made my choice the right one: I've lost a very important recording with a defective Transcend SDHC 16gb card when plugging it to my computer. So, first of all, I recommend buying cards from traditional brands, to avoid headaches. Second, as the HF10 has 16gb of internal memory, you're able to record to it and then copy the files to the SDHC card with the camera, before plugging it to the computer. With this simple procedure, the operation of transfering files to the computer becomes safer, as you have a backup.

Spoiler Alert!!
Everyone really needs to back off on Stephenie Meyer a little bit. Breaking Dawn was a wonderful book, a perfect ending to an amazing series. The only bad thing I have to say about it is that you just come to care about what happens to each character so much that the book is quite emotionally exhausting, and I don't even consider that as actually bad. It's great. Everyone on here is talking about the "message" the book sends that it's okay to get married, have kids, no college, whatever, by age 18. I don't honestly think Stephenie Meyer meant for this to be her "message." I think she wanted to write an amazing, exciting story about true love that involved characters that people really care about. If there's any message, it's about fighting to make things work for true love, as both Edward and Bella have always done, or the importance of family. And it does not always have to be college vs. marriage/family.  Bella is IMMORTAL, she has her whole life to get a degree if she chooses too. But honestly, she got everything that was most important to her in life--a almost-perfect husband who has made her the center of his world, a wonderful daughter, her best friend Jacob, and all the rest of her family. In the end, I think Stephenie Meyer realizes that these things are the most important things in the world anyway. Everyone is just reading way more into this than I think Ms. Meyer meant for it to be. I actually think Bella grew up alot in this book, esspecially after Reneesee's birth and her change. I love how, in the end, Bella and Edward more equal, and she got the chance to be the hero for once; she had the powers to take care of herself and all those people that she loved. 
Someone had a problem with Bella getting everything she wanted without having to sacrifice anything? Does anyone actually remember how many times Bella has almost been killed? The pain she went through because she knew she was hurting Jacob? Even though Bella did get everything she ever wanted and some things she didn't know she did, what's so wrong with that?!?! Do we need someone to die for this to be a good book? No. This was the ending I was expecting, the ending I had hoped for, and the way I think things should have all turned out.
And Jacob...Book II was really hard for me because I have always really liked Jacob. Even though I thought Bella and Edward were destined to be together, I wanted happiness for Jacob. I completely never saw the imprint with Nessie coming, but strangely enough, it works for me. Everything works out and everyone is happy.  
Stephenie Meyer--if you are reading these things anyway, I hope you read some of the good reviews too, because there are alot of people out there who really loved all your books! Thank you for what is probably my favorite books series ever. I look forward to Midnight Sun, (hopefully) all four movies, and anything else you might decide to write! Keep up the wonderful work, and thank you again!

This review is from: Iron Man (Two-Disc Special Collectors' Edition) (DVD)
      
It's been a long time since I've seen a movie in the movie theaters (having a one-year old will do that to you).  I've scrupulously avoided any spoilers for just about every summer movie out there, although more than one reviewer has given away quite a few surprises (I'm looking at you, Entertainment Weekly).  When we finally got a babysitter willing to take care of our little tyke for a few hours, we decided to given the second-run movie theater nearby a try.  And that movie was Iron Man.
By now everyone knows the story of Iron Man: alcoholic weapons-merchant billionaire Tony Stark has a change of heart (literally) when shrapnel penetrates his ribcage and threatens to end his life.  Instead of making weapons, Stark vows to make a power suit instead...that is loaded with weapons, but let's not quibble over details.
Iron Man is an adult's movie, which is to say it involves mature subjects like the fact that Stark is an inveterate womanizer, likes his alcohol, kills bad guys, and many of those bad guys look like Middle Eastern terrorists.  All this drama is tempered by Robert Downey Jr., who rattles off quips with abandon.  His keeper is Obadiah Stane (played by Jeff Bridges with suitable cranky menace).  Stark's assistant is the alliterative Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), who runs the line between sweetly na�ve and sleekly sexy in her five-inch heels and pencil skirt.  
At its best, Iron Man features Stark uses his power suit to dodge jet fighters, kill terrorists, and rescue civilians.  The theater I was in didn't have very good audio, so the (presumably adlibbed) one-liners that Downey constantly tosses off were often lost in the sounds of explosions and screaming.  I imagine in a bigger theater or at home this wouldn't be a problem, but the movie lost some of its charm as a result.
There are plot holes. Vanity Fair reporters show up at important news conferences. Stark seems far more interested in building a power suit than removing the shrapnel from his body.  And the entire premise of Iron Man revolves around "repulsor lift" technology, which is an infinite source of energy the size of a hockey puck that defies gravity. But if you didn't buy into the notion of a man in a flying suit, what are you doing watching the movie, right?
Iron Man keeps the plot tight. Unlike Spider-Man, there are no extraneous supervillains. Unlike X-Men, every character is there for a reason.  But the big payoff for Iron Man is the ending.  Iron Man flips traditional superhero conventions the bird and dares you to guess what happens next.  Then it leaves you begging for more. 
And there IS more, if you stay for the end of the credits.  Unfortunately, I didn't read enough spoilers to realize I should have waited, so we missed it.  So for the three of you who haven't seen the movie yet...stick around!

I've only used the grinder once, and that was to grind round roast to make chili con carne.  The grinder was easy to use and clean.  All of the parts but the cutting knife and the perforated disc could be cleaned in the dishwasher.  A real plus for a device that handles raw meat.
     The hopper fed the grinding mechanism easily resulting in an ideal thick grind of meat for this recipe. I used the larger holed cutting disc.  You do have to watch for silverskin membrane or gristle.  It can clog the device, but then you just need to remove the front screw cover, disc, and knife to remove the blockage and continue to happily grind away.  
I would not recommend using this device to vegetarians or to the faint of heart. Grinding meat can be a disgusting process even to the recreational meat-eater.  After my children witnessed the grinding-of-the-meat, they are contemplating becoming vegetarians, the desired result!
By the way the chili was delicious, but it gave me horrible heartburn.  I do not nold the grinder responsible for my heavy hand with the hot sauce.

It could not be easier indeed! After reding a lot of reviews from different brands and models, I finally made up mind to buy this beast. And boy oh boy, everything is easy! Just plug the power, plug the USB, and you're ready to roll! Just follow the intructions on the screen. What I like about this is it's very quiet. ;) The built of the unit feels very solid and compact. This is exactly what I'm looking for in an external hard drive. Transfering my movies was a breeze. It's fast! Everything was perfect for me! woot woot! ;) I recommend this to anyone looking for anexternal hard drive. I'm extremely pleased.

I needed an easy way to transfer data from one location to another so a jump drive was a good solution.  I needed more storage than some people due to the file sizes I deal with.  I looked at quite a few 1GB, and larger, units.  The price (under $30) was a big plus.  I don't need anything fancy like password protection or biometric encryption so the pny flash drive usb is perfect for my needs.

This is my 2nd Drinkwell, and I can't say enough about it.  We had different brand pet fountains in the past, and none of them lasted longer than a few months.  Our veterinarian recommended the Drinkwell, and all four of our cats absolutely love it.  They drink more water now which contributes to their good health.  It is very easy to clean, especially when put into the dishwasher.  When it is in the dishwasher, the cats will sit and wait for it to come out.  I highly recommend this fountain over any other pet fountains on the market.

I bought this when my Network Router went on the blink.  Since I had a DSL Modem with a firewall, I didn't need another router and this product allowed me to connect 5 computers to the switch.  Installation took about 5 minutes and I noticed an increase in speed right away.  I recommend this product to someone that doesn't need a firewall.

This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)
      
I absolutely loved this book. From it's massively devastating beginning, to the fast-paced, action-packed ending. Stephenie Meyer's portrayal of true love gone forever, supposedly, will have readers crying along with Bella and just as anxious as she is to know what became of Edward. And you feel extremely sympathetic for poor, sweet, Jacob Black. He helps Bella so much throughout the story, that you almost wish she would "let him be happy" as she says in the story. But then Edward returns and even though you really like Jake, you really LOVE Edward and you feel as elated as Bella does when they get back together.
My point is, Meyer's characters seem so realistic, and have so much personality, so much depth, it's enough to make anyone believe in vampires!

This is a neat little unit, produces what the manufacturer says it will. Just add your milk and add (any plain live culture yogurt will do !) your culture and in the 8-10 hrs you have fresh yogurt. I use mine almost daily to make the kids a good fresh fruit smoothy for breakfast. I love it because I get to control the sugar levels and no preserves or food dye's. the kids love them too. this unit makes a quart at a time which is enough for a nice family meal and reserve enough for the next mornings starter. No complaints!!!

My daughter had outgrown her Carter's sleep sacks, but still needed something cozy at night.  I bought this even though some reviews said it was HUGE, and it fit her just right.  She sleeps much better when she's unable to move her legs around too much.

My cat spent 20 minutes at the this water bowl the minute I set it up and turned it on. I used to worry he never spent any time at his little ceramic kitty bowl. Thank you Drinkwell for making my kitty happy and keeping him healthy. 
(MUCH easier than the blue water fountain bowl by Petmate. My old roommates used to have that one for our cats and I would swear up a storm every time I had to clean that stupid thing. What a nightmare that was with all of it's nooks and crannies that you could never get into. The pieces were a pain to fit together even to fill it. Of course you could never fill it w/o needing to clean it b/c it was always dirty.)

I have to say this is the best blender ever.  1)It's small 2)It's portable 3)Easy clean-up 4)It's powerful.  I have to say I was very doubtful that this little blender was going to do the job I needed it to.  I make protein shakes twice a day with full-sized ice cubes.  My big Cuisinart duet was too big for just making one shake and had not enough power behind it.  I gave it the ultimate test and put huge ice-cubes and banana in the mix with my protein powder.  To my amazement it made the BEST shake ever.  Not only did it blend the ice and banana into the shake, it made a frothy thick shake that was thick and yummy.  I normally let it blend for about 90 seconds.  The key is putting the correct amount of ice into your drink.  I figured I'd test it out for at least a couple of weeks before I put a review up.  It is still going strong.  I even bought a second one for work.  I bought mine at Wal-Mart for $14.95.  It was the best money I ever spent.  The sippy cup top is perfect because now I don't have to transfer my shake from blender to cup and miss a drop of shake.  The cup top is soft and perfectly shaped so you don't get the "dribble-cup" effect.  If I am running late in the morning I just make the shake and take with me in the car.  It's even good for mixing salad dressings or other wet things together.  I highly recommend this little blender...and I am the most picky person ever.

This is a fantastic camera but people need to have more realistic expectations of what to expect from AVCHD. It is a highly compressed format so using this camera in low-light conditions is going to produce pretty "grainy" results. In good lighting AVCHD output from this camera can produce some really great looking results in HD but don't kid yourself into thinking you're going to get professional HDTV quality. This is a point-and-shoot.
I love the camera, especially how fast it focuses in good light, so I'm going to concentrate on what some of the other reviewers said to correct some misconceptions.
I use both Macs and PC and I have to tell you that you that PCs suck for AVCHD - you will waste a lot of time and pull your hair out. I'm sure PC video software vendors will address this eventually, but seriously folks if you want to do this the easy way get an Intel-based Mac (caveat: only Intel based machines using Leopard support AVCHD) and use either iMovie or Final Cut Express 4. Both of these programs (iMovie 08 and FCE4) just LOVE this camera (and two other Sony AVCHD cameras I've tried as well) and they work like a charm. Video making has never been this easy.  FCE4 lets you mix AVHCD, HDV and SD video on the same timeline and save in whatever format you want so it's worth the $200 if you want to do that or have more exacting control over your videos. It is basically a (lightly) stripped-down version of Apple's excellent professional video software (Final Cut Pro) and it is very good. For most home videos iMovie 08 (which comes in iLife 08) will be just fine. 
I've had no problem transferring the movies directly from the camera but, as mentioned earlier, you do need to have the camera plugged into the AC to do it. You can avoid plugging the camera into your Mac to transfer the files if you're only recording on SDHC cards, rather than internal memory on the HF10, but it works just fine. For this reason I would recommend buying the HF100 (over the HF10) and getting an extra 16Gb memory card or two. You will save money that way and have more flexibility. I bought the HF10 because I had to have it the next day and, at the time, the HF100s were delayed a bit. Transcend's excellent 16Gb SDHC Class 6 card comes with a nifty little card reader for only $78.98 here on Amazon, you can get two of them for less than the $200 difference in price between the HF10 and HF100 so you'll have 32gb to work with instead of 16gb for less money. I don't mind having the internal memory as a backup but you pay more than it is worth for it. 
The video camera is just acting like a USB reader when you connect it to your Mac anyway - it is the file layouts that the software recognizes. When read in and converted to Apple Intermediate Codec at 1920x1080 they will balloon in size. If you want to store the raw video in a more compressed way you can simply copy the root directory of the card to another directory and copy it back again later. If you're working with AVCHD you need to buy the biggest hard drives you can afford. 60 minutes of video will use up something like 50Gb of storage on your Mac when converted to 1920x1080. If you just want great looking home video to show on your HDTV, but don't want to go broke on hard drives, Apple offers to import the movies at a slightly lower resolution (960x540) which takes up a LOT less space with very little drop in quality.  I have been making home videos and showing them on an Apple TV at that resolution and they look stunning. The quality difference between that resolution and full HD isn't that big of a deal.  
If want to try to get truly professional-quality video you should avoid AVCHD cameras and stick to the HDV format concentrating on cameras with larger sensors.  But this is great camera for HD home videos at a great price. 
The user interface on this camera is slow and clunky. Sony's AVCHD cameras have a better interface (using a touch screen) but you can still watch back the videos (which is the main thing you'll do) and it beats the heck out of a tape camera.  I wish they had added a dial or button set for adjust exposure and/or backlighting control on the camera. The joystick works surprisingly well for this however in bright light the screen gets washed out enough that it is hard to tell if your exposure is really that great or not. This is where a viewfinder would really help. But these are minor nits because the camera does a good job at exposure control on its own. 
As I said earlier this is a very compact point-and-shoot camera that shoots HD video and for that it's excellent.

I am not exactly sure why Stephenie's books are so riveting - there is just something about the way she tells the story - simply amazing! 
This book is pretty much a downer of a book, yet I continued to turn the pages at a rapid pace, waiting for what I could only hope would eventually happen, and I was not disappointed!
As I stated in my review of Twilight, I do not believe these books would be half as good, written by a man. Stephenie is somehow able to pour the intensity of her character's emotions directly into the written word, where you yourself end up directly feeling the agonizing pain or extreme joy, as if you yourself knew these characters personally.
If you have not yet decided to read this series, I highly recommend that you do so!!

This toothbrush is quite a bargain....I felt like a just brushed dentist feeling after using this toothbrush for the first time.
</review>
<review id="1038" label="1">
I won't lie - I had to convince myself to spend the money for this brush - even after all of the good reviews.  I'm glad I did.
I have a pug/chihuahua mix.  You'd think he'd only have so much hair to lose.  But every day, I'd be cleaning tons of hair off our hard wood floors.  I used the Zoom Groom (rubber brush) and it was fairly effective at removing loose top-coat hairs but that's it.  He has a very thick undercoat and I wanted a way to remove a lot of that hair that was going to end up on my floor.
First - about the brush - it's very solid and well made.  Comes with a plastic guard to cover the teeth which is great because the last thing you want to do after paying for the brush is to bend them.  Feels well made and not like I just paid to get a cheap piece of plastic so that was good.
So!  I held Little Filthy and Furminated him.  I felt like I was sheering a sheep.  I'd run the brush down him in long strokes and a wad of hair would come up on the brush.  It must have felt good because he sat still (no small accomplishment).  I was definitely careful around his sides and legs where the hair is far less dense as the metal comb part could hurt his skin.  I had to convince myself to stop because it was pretty rewarding.  Instant gratification, like mowing the yard.  More and more hair would come out.  I sort of shudder to think that he was going to lose all of that hair on my floor otherwise.
[...].
Now, I brush the monster about twice a week and I'd say it has reduced the amount of hair on the floor a good 90%.  
Overall review:  It's pricey for a dog brush but 1) it works and 2) it is well made.  I'm recommending it to other pet owners.

This fourth book of the series by Stephenie Meyer was wonderful!  I just learned about this series this summer, and finished all 4 books within a month's time!  The story is so intriquing and really puts you in the characters' lives.  I recommend these books for everyone of all ages, I am 25 and seriously enjoyed this series!  I hope Stephenie Meyer decides to continue with these characters' developments in the future for more books to come!

This thing is perfect for the nice fuzz to heavy beard trimming. I've always prefered trimming short than shaving mostly because its easier on my skin and doesn't give me acne. It also sucks up the hairs better than I've ever seen it. With the turbo setting on, I only had 3 tiny hairs that missed the vaccuum. In my impression and with previous experiences, thats the best selling point for this trimmer. No one wants a mess to clean up with.

After returning the Capresso we tried the Zojirushi.  Wow it is so much better!  Coffee stays hot and fresh for a LONG time.  The fill-line indicator is easy to see.  It does take a smaller #3 filter but we push a #4 paper filter in with no ill effects. The only negative is that it is difficult to get a good grip on the carafe cover because it is flat and fairly smooth.

I highly recommend this sharpener! I checked around (a lot) and after reading many reviews I gave it a try. Wow! Super easy, fast and really sharp knives!! Honestly, I can't believe it is so affordable and does this good of a job. This thing goes to town grinding so I don't think I'd want to do it all the time. I have expensive J.A. Henckels knives and they are like new again! Follow the directions exactly because it doesn't take much to really grind these things. I did manage to take out a bit of the beginning of my blade (closest to handle) on one of my knives but this was user error. Just do what the instructions say and you'll be fine. If you have a few older knives that you don't care about as much, I would practice on them first.
I will never have dull knives again and slicing tomatoes is a whole new experience - amazing!
I am really picky and research everything before buying so if I'm pleased you can feel confident in ordering this.

After reading other reviews about toaster ovens in the same price range, we decided on this one and so far we have been very pleased with it.  It toasts evenly and quickly and bakes/reheats well too.  The top of the oven does get very hot so you wouldn't want rest anything on it or have small children near it when its on, but I've found that that is true of other toaster ovens I've owned. I love how the shelf "pops" out when you open it so that you don't have to reach in and risk getting burned.  It does have "odd" oven temperatures but I have found that easy to work around. It could be slightly bigger--4 slices of toast is a very tight fit. The stainless steel look is nice and matches the rest of the appliances in the kitchen.

I've used this 8GB flash drive dozens of times in the very short time I've had it. It's held up perfectly.
On my windows xp system it goes a little slower than some flash drives I've used, but the lack of U3 more than makes up for it.
On my windows vista system it goes like lightning. I can dump a full 8GB on it in just a few minutes. I could have never done that with my old flash drive.
On that note, I had no problems switching back and forth between xp and vista. Simply plug it in and fill it up, then unload it on whatever other system you want.
Considering how cheap it is, I don't think you can find a better deal.

Let's see.  What's right with this? 
* No need for special software - can drag and drop files from explorer OR windows media player. 
* Great sound quality
* Tiny fit-in-shirt-pocket size
* Great screen 
* Simple user interface 
* Expansion slot so I can have books on one sd card and music on another 
What would make it MORE perfect?  
* If the spinning of the thumb wheel was virtual instead of mechanical, I worry about it breaking 
* If it allowed me to do Fast Forward and Reverse in audio books rather than just starting over at the track beginning.  :-(  
* If I could bookmark INSIDE a track so that I could come back to an audio book at the point I left off.  
But for what this costs, I can't complain - 5 stars

Alex you have no right to say what you did about Battlestar Galactica. They shouldn't let you haters here. The new Starbuck is the best character there has ever been. Lord of the Rings? Battlestar is better than Lord of the Rings. It's better than Star Wars, or SG-1. So are Desperate Housewives and West Wing. They also aren't science fiction and that's what makes them great. Science fiction is lame and old. You need to update yourself and get with the modern program Alex. Lord of the Rings could never happen. It's just plain bad compared to Battlestar.

Customer review from the Amazon Vine&amp;#8482; Program (What's this?)
      
This is the latest version of MS Office.  If you need it, you need it.  But why would you as a noncommercial user buy this instead of the Student/Teacher edition, which is usually cheaper and can be installed on 3 computers?
There are three reasons.
1) This package is updatable, where the Student/Teacher edition is not.
2) This one is sometimes priced lower than the Student/Teacher edition.  It goes on sale fairly often.  If you have only one computer, get this one if the price is right.
3) You want the special media edition stuff.  You get two items.  One is a set of useful but not worldbeating Automator actions that support workflows.  The other is a drag and drop media library/management tool. 
Both items are nice, but if you have more than one computer, go with the Student/Teacher edition.  
One more note:  Office 2008 doesn't support VBA macros.  If your work depends on macros, stick with Office 2004 or get Office 2007 Student/Teacher for Windows and run it under Windows on your Mac.  Macros are supposed to be back in a future version.  Let's hope so.

I love this pedometer.  I have been through at least 20 of the cheaper pedometers.  The doors break, the clips break, they aren't accurate.
This one is fantastic.  Since I do my online step recording at work, the memory feature is incredibly helpful.  I don't have to remember to do that right before bed, just pull it up the next day.  It's comfortable to wear (you can even toss it in a pocket) it doesnt' have to be perfectly straight to record properly, and it's the most accurate one I've ever owned.
And for everything that it does, the setup is incredibly simple.  This is definitely worth it's price!

I bought this as a playpen substitute. It's as advertised, so I don't have any complaint about the quality, but up close it looks even cheaper than it does in the photo. The person who said it looks like a dog kennel nailed it. So if you're looking for something that will go well with the decor in your living room, don't bother with this.
The way it looks doesn't bother me that much; what does bother me is that my son, by the age of 12 months, had learned how to push this thing around. It doesn't anchor to anything, so he started to shove it all over the living room, making it tip and generally creating chaos. My solution was to attach those removable non-marring 3M "Command" hooks to the wall and tie coated wire around them, then lash that wire to the play yard. It doesn't look beautiful, that's for sure, but it works; the play yard doesn't budge any more. If your little one is walking, you too will have to jury-rig a solution to their tendency to push the yard around and even lift it if they're strong enough.
I also recommend you get those colorful interlocking foam tiles to put under the play yard; it makes the play area a bit safer. Amazon sells the "Edushape" brand, but you can get various brands just about anywhere.
All in all, it's not an elegant solution, but weary parents who need a break will love it with all its flaws.

I needed a new coffeemaker after my Faberware Percolator (cordless/programmable) died within a year of use. I didn't want to go back to the standard drip machines, because I had gotten used to a really HOT cup of coffee from the percolator.
As I searched the internet for a replacement, I came across the new single serve machines. They sounded so attractive, but I was skeptical.  After researching here's why I chose the Keurig B60...
-excellent reviews!!!
-a HOT FRESH cup of REAL coffee ANYTIME
-huge variety of coffee/teas(even organic/environmental options)
-hot water on demand (hot choc, teas, and soups, instant oatmeals...)
-filter available to brew your own coffee(extra purchase)*other machines  don't have this option*
-easy to no clean-up
-brewing temp. adjustability
-K-cups locally available
-time saver(no more washing coffee pot or filter)
-NO MORE WASTING COFFEE
-3 cup sizes (cup, mug, travel mug)*other machines don't have this option*
-time display, and on/off programmable
-purchased w/20%coupon at LinensnThings
-looks nice on your counter(that's a lower priority, but a nice "benny")
-if you like warm-ups you are still able to do that by using a larger mug and just brewing smaller cup size the second time around.
There are 6 people in our family from 8yrs-42yrs and all are able to use this machine easily even the hubby : ) WE ALL LOVE IT!!!

This keyboard is an excellent keyboard, however not so special for gaming.
     -The "G" keys: the G keys are 15 keys on the left side of the kayboard that allow you to program in macros. This is useful for programming, IM or whatever, but really isn't all that useful for gaming; all you can do is type messages more quickly
     -The LCD screen: yes, this seems like a cool addition because you can keep tabs of IMs and whatever, but its functionality is limited and uses up a lot of ram for such a small little toy
     -The backlit keys: pretty nice, but not that easy to see from an angle. I still think that the powerbook/macbook backlit keys are the best. The LCD screen also lights up.
     -Key matrix: The key matrix is the internal brains that says how many keys can be pressed down at a time and which ones can and can't. This is poorly designed because it only allows the W, A, S and D keys to be pressed down at one time, but if you like the arrows or have another configuration, you're screwed for gaming.
     -Other stuff- The typing feels pretty good- not a lot of stress and feels comfortable. The two USB ports are nice (although they aren't high powered) and in general is constructed well. 
     -software: fairly easy to use, however there are only a couple of games where you can monitor ammo that are pre-installed. Macro programming easy.
Overall: A great keyboard for whatever you're doing. It doesn't help out a whole lot in gaming, but still has a lot of cool features. If you're a hardcore gamer, get both this and the Wolf Claw Devour FPS Keypad ([...]). They work great  because you can keep track of IMs, whatever, have very easy to use keyboard controls for gaming (wolf claw) and also be able to type to people quickly with programmmable macros.

This product does what it claims to, and I've never had any mechanical problems with it.  Be forewarned, however; for the most part, this machine will NOT work as a mixer and sometimes not in blending applications either.  As a guy in his mid-20's, I figured it would do it all.  No such luck, but it's great for its intended purposes!

After searching a lot of places and reading reviews I decided on this one.  The size is good especially for pizza.  I like the size because it is taller instead of wider like some ovens since the controls are on the bottom instead of the side.  It seems to toast well and cooks well.  The only thing I wish it had was an interior light.  It is pretty dark inside.  The outside can get a little hot but not enough to damage the wall that it is next to on the counter.  The handle stays pretty cool on the door but I still use a mit at all times.  The construction feels tough and durable, not flimsy like the cheaper models.  I have had this for a few months now and it is working great!

I researched many different juicers before purchasing and have found this juicer to have had the best reviews.  Not only does this thing perform like the reviews say,it also is maore than easy to clean.  The price may be a seem a little steep, but the way I look at it is this.  Why buy three cheap juicers that will eventually break, when you can buy a stainless steel juicer that will last you for years to come.  Enjoy

I've never owned a yogurt maker before so I don't have too much to compare it to, but I really do like it.  Making yogurt is really easy and being the novice that I am, it still turns out perfect everytime.  I also drain it using cheesecloth to make a thicker "Greek style" yougurt and can substitute this for sour cream.  I would recommend this to anyone interested in making their own yogurt.

The most salient issue I observed in Rachel Getting Married was the complexity of what it means to truely love. We can see the obvious love between Rachel and her finace, the betrothed and their friends, and the father for his children. We are challenged to consider what part forgiveness, guilt and responsibility play in these complex relationships, and how we can better show our love for each other.
Rachel Getting Married is an emotional rollercoaster, showing us unparalled joy and destitution, making both more palpable. This movie is sure to enter my list of long term favorites.

This unit performed beyond expectation; I'm writing this on an inexpensive laptop some 50 feet from the transmitter. Setup was unexpectedly simple, thanks to genuinely helpful and instructive step-by-step clearly illustrated guidance (in actual English) from the installation CD. Worked the first time around.
Not so good is the companion dual-band USB receiver that is virtually useless with desktops. Don't be fooled by the glowing picture on the box of all-around the house reception. This unit works best with laptops having builtin WiFi capability.
Worth noting (and not clearly indicated) is that setup is for Windows machines only. Mac users are out of luck. On-line help is an atrocious 'Catch-22' with no way of email interaction with tech help [try asking for help setting up a Mac]. Overall, an outstanding Windows router - fully deserving of PCWorld's top ranking.

I've owned this machine for a bit over a year.  I didn't make much coffee until my girlfriend moved in. It's been brewing 1-2 pots a day for the past 9 months now.  When she first tasted the coffee that came out of it (I also use a Braun burr mill grinder), she was amazed.  Better than you can buy at most restaurants.  So, it's saved me a lot of money by just making great coffee here at home.  Slow?  Yes, a bit.  But that's because the water has to stay in contact with the grounds for a while to extract the flavor.  I have a couple of complaints about the coffee maker, however.  The hole to pour the water in is rather small, but once you develop a bit of patience with it and have a paper towel to sop up the little water that my not have hit the hole, it's not bad.  The next is a good feature, but I do get a little careless at times.  The carafe fits tightly on the warming plate and if it's not placed in correctly while brewing, the brewing coffee can spill over the edge of the filter basket when it fills up.  That makes for quite a mess.  But I've only done that twice and the last time was about 6 month ago.  Now I check it if I'm going to pour a cup before it's done brewing.  The tight fit is a nice feature because you know the carafe is place properly and won't leak, but you can't be so lazy as to not make sure it's seated right.  So I've learned.  But I'd buy this one again, and recommend it to friends.

My old waffle iron, circa 1970, took about a half hour to warm up and then about 10 minutes to produce a square 4 piece waffle.  The waffle maker is a big clunker and can be converted into a two part griddle for making sandwiches and other like items which I never used. 
My new machine is quick - quick to warm up and quick to make a small, round waffle a bit thinner than on my old one.  My Norwegian lady friend likes my waffles so much that I am going to buy her a Cuisinart waffle maker just like mine.

This review is from: Iron Man [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)
      
"Iron Man" is good.  Damn good.  I'm not sure if it's a good adaptation (I've never been much of a comic book guy), though from what I've heard from my comic-reading friends, it is.  But I can tell you this: It is a good movie.  A good movie that just so happens to be based upon a comic book character.
Tony Stark is a billionaire playboy.  He's a womanizer and a partier, who has a soft spot for his personal assistant (who, predictably enough, has a soft spot for him in return).  His company (created by his father, co-run by Obediah Stane) provides high-tech weaponry to the Army, and so Stark's best friend is an Army officer in charge of the Special Weapons Division.  Life is good...until, on a promotional trip in Afghanistan, something goes wrong.  Stark's motorcade is ambushed...mortally wounded, Stark is taken captive kept alive through the use of a magnet that is keeping some shrapnel from entering his heart.  The magnet gives him an idea...an idea for a suit...
I had my doubts when I heard Robert Downey Jr. was cast in the role.  Don't get me wrong--I am a huge fan of his, and was determined to see the movie.  I was just afraid it wouldn't work--that he would be too far above the material.  Thank God, everyone else involved in making the movie was on the same page (I've heard that Downey apparently had a lot of say in various aspects of the film, and there was a lot of improvised dialogue).  Downey pulls it off marvelously--it's hard to picture anybody else playing the wise-cracking, smart-alleck, yet deeply-troubled Tony Stark.  Jeff Bridges is a villanous wonder; aside from the fact that I was at first convinced he was William Hurt (sorry, Jeff), I was absolutely captivated by his performance.  (And no offense to William Hurt, either, who could have pulled off the role; and will, to an extent, in "The Incredible Hulk.")
Terrence Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow round out the primary cast, each bringing three-dimensional life to their roles (and both actors were under-used).  The script is superb; the special-effects aren't anything we haven't seen, but are still top-notch (not ALL movies have to break new ground).  Both the beginning and the end are a bit of a let-down: the movie opens with AC/DC, and I sighed a little on my first viewing, thinking, "Really?  You couldn't have come up with something a little less-cliched?"  Fortunately, thirty seconds later, things picked up.  And the ending...there was a lot of build-up, and the ending just left me feeling disappointed.  Of course, as good as the first two-thirds of the movie is, it's hard to beat that.  And then there's the real ending, after the credits, which proves two things: one, that there will DEFINITELY be a sequel; and two, that Samuel L. Jackson really is in every movie ever made.
So go see "Iron Man."  That's the gist of it.  There's definitely an anti-war point being made (from what I've heard, the comics did the same with the Vietnam War, so if anti-war stuff ain't your bag, blame the comic writers, not the filmmakers).  But overall, "Iron Man" is just a good time.  It's a good movie, filled with good special effects and great acting.  And Stan Lee gets to play a pimp.  I mean, really now.  You have to go see it for that, if nothing else.

I am very upset after having the hair iron for three months it no longer will heat up. The red light will come on and off and no longer heats up. I contacted Amazon to exchange for another one that is not defective and they denied to do so. They said that I had to have returned it within 30 days or have a warranty. Well in 30 days it was still working so that wasn't an option. Had I known it would break 90 das later I would have never spent the money on a high end Chi iron. Then I asked about if they even offer warranties for hair irons, they checked with a manager and said no. So how am I supposed to have a warranty for an item they don't even offer one for. Basically I spent $100 on a hair iron I expected to last me years and had it for 90 days, which is as long as a cheap one lasts. I am very disapointed with Amazon and there inability to rectify a a defected product and replace it with a new one. I still think the product is great, my hair dresser uses hers everyday and has had her for years. I think the one I got might have just been defective. What I am upset over it the way Amazon has handled this situation. VERY DISAPOINTED!

This is the product I've been looking for since junior high.  I have thick, coarse hair with a strong curl, and no matter how I blow dried it it's always come out straw-like and puffy.  I tried flat irons when they first showed up at drug stores years ago, but they barely made a difference.  Ten minutes with the CHI flat iron and it's sleek, glossy, smooth, gorgeous.  A complete transformation.  And it *stays* that way, for days.  Unreal.  My one complaint it that is gets the hair so hot, I'm burning my thumbs by moving the just-ironed hair.  But it's worth it.  I just wish this thing had been around when I was in high school, so those frizzy haired pictures wouldn't exist.

We bought this product, Flip Digital Video camcorder for our sons, aged 35+, as a christams present. We were worried once we had purchased it as both of them have I pods and other camcorders. We had no need to be worried they were both highly satisfied with the gift, it gives them instant access, via the computer or TV,  to the video they have just taken. It is so easy to operate just switch on and point. The quality of the recording is exceptional considering its small size. As we have just said, the beauty of the Flip is its small size, it will fit into a handbag , pocketbook, golf bag, beachbag or whatever you are taking with you. Think how many times you have seen something you would have liked to record in that instant and have not been able to, this solves the problem. Would I reccommend it? in a heartbeat. This is what we call value for money.

I love the compactness of this waterpik.  I had the larger one and this one is far more convenient.  You don't have to invert the reservoir and the power of the jet is actually stronger than the bigger model.  Granted, the smaller amount of liquid in the reservoir was a little disappointing, but I just keep another cup ready to refill it while I am still using the pik.  It is definitely easy to use and, of course, that means it will be used more often and the check ups at the dentist attest to the positive impact it has.  I most often use a salt &amp; warm water solution and it works great.

This movie was so difficult to watch! It was a story I had not heard before so went to the theater blind to see it.  What went on to happen was unexpected and heart wrenching. Angelina Jolie's performance was phenomenal. She made this movie what it is. Without her emotion and reverence throughout the movie it wouldn't have been half as moving as it was. 
The film was exceptionally well written and equally well shot and directed. The imagery was moving and the shots epic.

This review is from: Tropic Thunder (DVD)
      
This is one of the few movies that I view multiple times (6 to be precise). Downey steals the show here with his portrayal of the hippest brother ever to grace the screen: "I'm the dude playing the dude disguised as another dude."  Please rent this if you like to laugh. One of the few films that get funnier with multiple viewings as you begin to appreciate the incredible subtleties and genius of Downey's performance.  The guy is simply more black than black dudes! The portrayal is done with taste and I hope it is not offensive considering the legacy of blackface.  It would be a shame if someone was hurt by this film.
Downey deserved the Oscar for this instead of Ledger.  It is much more difficult to portray someone when the audience has a frame of reference (a black dude), as opposed to Ledger's obscure portrayal of a psychopath. Ledger had the luxury of playing that role however he saw fit, and we would never know if he was off the mark or not.  If Downey's performance was off, it would have failed miserably.

This drive is by far one of the best designed USB flash drive that I have ever own or seen. I'm an architecture student and I constantly need to transfer drawing and image files rangeing from 100kbs to 1+Gbs between a series of computer; this drives size and acceptable speed deffinately enable me to do this. I need to have a flash drive with me constantly and I have found that the only way that I can remember to bring it with me in the morning after 3-4 nights with out sleep is to leave it on my keys.I also work construction and in the past, most drive that i have left on my keys have only been able to last ~1 month before they were just completely non-functional. Thus I found myself going through flash drives like M&amp;M's.
  It is larger than most drives however its about the same length as my trucks key. It is TOUGH. I've had it quite some time now and ever part of it is just as tough as ever. Be aware that "aircraft aluminum" will be very suceptible to cosmetic damage hower i find that i really just gives it a more convicing arugment for its design. It's water proof design allows me also to do my laundry with my keys in my poket witch is also quite a frequent occurance. All of this and it's backed up by a 10 YEAR warrenty.

I have 3 TB external drives which I use for TV recorded shows from cable.  I found that if you buy (2) TDK 100 lot spindle DVDs and the 200 plastic cases you almost reach a point where the cost is equivalent to the cost of the cheapest TB externals available, either from NEWEGG.COM or Amazon.Com.  I'm lucky if 200 DVDs are enough for one month of recording because I have to use the externals to hold the copy protected shows and try to transfer over the other saved shows to TDK 2.5 HOUR DVDs in an ASAP manner.  I have two LACIE and 1 IOMEGA and actually cannot tell any difference among them.  When they are formated, the formatting seems to take up quite a lot of space.  And buy units with an on/off switch.  I have noticed on my computer if I have all 4 externals running (includes 1 Maxtor 320GB which I use for gaming) plus have a lot of other USB stuff hooked up, you will occassionally get the blue screen on bootup which is required when your computer goes bonkers.  I would buy just the cheapest TB's unless you have lots of money or want to feel safer if used as backup units.

Pros: -the video converting software was simple enough
-videos were clear, once in a while some graphics got distorted in a small part of the screen but that might have been due to the quality of my video
cons:*-I am partly returning this player because the lowest volume setting is not quiet enough when I am indoors. It starts to hurt my ears. I lowered all of the EQ settings, and tried various EQ settings but, it was still too loud, and it lowered the sound quality. It was also perhaps too much treble. I tried using a few different headphones and some were able to reduce the treble a little. But, the difference was not good enough for me. It seems like there a few other people out there who had the same issue if you look on the sansa fuze forum official website. I would invest in the headphone volume control if it were not for the fact that I realized I also would just prefer a smaller mp3 player. In comparison, the ipod shuffle 2nd generation has less "treble", and therefore easier on my ears. I can not remember which had the better sound quality.

Customer review from the Amazon Vine&amp;#8482; Program (What's this?)
      
I am making the switch from a traditional blade and shave-gel to electric shaving system with the Philips Norelco 8240XL. Based on my experience a few years ago which left me with irritated skin and ingrown hairs, I was not expecting much. After a few weeks of use, I am pleasantly surprised. No skin irritation or any more ingrown hairs than I get with traditional shaving. 
Pluses: It is easy to use and much faster than traditional shaving. After using it, it is very easy to clean using the included brush. The kit includes a small charger (no bulky transformer which makes transportation easier) and a collapsible case. I appreciate the case versus the hard case I had with the shaver I used a few years ago; the form factor for storage is convenient and thoughtful.
Minuses: 
1. It leaves a mess. Every time I shave the counter is scattered with little hairs. Rather than gathering them up in a lather like traditional shaving or keeping them inside (which would require more frequent cleanings), the 8240XL seems to just spit the little hairs all over a 3 foot diameter. It, therefore, requires a little more cleanup than traditional shaving and is not as good for shaving in the car as I might have hoped. 
2. Not good for long hairs. It is very effective at clipping off day-old hairs. As hairs get longer it tends to miss them. This is a self-perpetuating problem. If I shave quickly and leave a few stragglers, there is a lesser chance that these will be clipped off tomorrow than the shorter ones. After a few days I have a few long hairs among a well-shaven face. At that point, I give it a run with the traditional razor which takes care of it. Likewise, if I skip shaving for a few days between workdays, it is pretty much useless, very slow, and somewhat more irritating to my skin than traditional shaving. That said, if I'm careful to do a thorough job each morning without skipping days, the 8240XL is very effective and quite a bit more time-efficient than my old method. 
Understanding its limitations and maximizing its benefits, I am happy to make daily use of the Norelco 8240XL supplementing it with traditional shaving at times. Especially considering the low price point, I would recommend the 8240XL with some cautions to those considering it.

I am so happy I ordered this.  I have known about Tracy for some time and after seeing her on Oprah was pleased to see there are DVD's available.  
It is only Tracy doing the workout, which makes me feel more like I have a personal trainer.  Her directions and comments are appropriate and the music corresponds well to the moves.  The changes can be quick but with repeated viewings, I don't see a problem in picking them up.  It's much more graceful than any run-of-the-mill workout.  In fact, I would go so far as to call it "purposeful movement" rather than exercise.  I can definitely say it's something I will look forward to doing rather than dreading.  Also, there isn't a lot of babble and bubbly encouragement, which I'm grateful for.  
I can't imagine a muscle that isn't worked during this routine.  It is a challenge and if you're just starting out, just do what you can and work your way up to it.  It will take me some time to be able to do it as effortlessly as Tracy does.  
The contents of the Disc are: Mat Intro - 1:02, Mat Workout - 57:28 (Includes warm-up and cool-down), Gwyneth Interview - 0:56, Tracy Interview - 2:56.  You need a basic mat sized area, mat if you are on a hard surface, 3 lb weights and a chair. It starts with warm-up then standing legs, standing abs, standing arms, standing arms with weights, mat legs, mat abs then finishes with cool-down. 
One caveat - During the floor ab work, make sure that your hands are simply supporting your head or there for placement rather than lifting it.  She does keep a distance between chin and chest and mentions it, but if you're not familiar with the move, it may appear that she is lifting her head with her hands a bit. Lifting the head rather than the upper body won't target the proper muscles and more importantly can cause neck strain or injury.  
*I don't think there is any further instruction needed, the moves are simple &amp; basic but the combination and amount is more than effective.

This review is from: Iron Man [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)
      
With a meteoric rise from first-time film making Marvel Enterprises, we get to see an action-packed, funny, and eye-popping movie with a perfect cast and an even more perfect script.
To start with, IRON MAN needed a great lead character. Tony Stark is known to be cocky, good-looking, and an all-around bad-boy. So who better to inhabit this persona than Robert Downey Jr. (Good Night, and Good Luck). I think most people know Downey Jr.'s difficulties and run-ins with the law over the past several years, and I could think of no one better to pull off this character than someone who has some of those very same flaws. 
You also need a good villain, and Obadiah Stane was the perfect stab-in-the-back. Played very well by the surprising Jeff Bridges (Tideland), I found myself repulsed by his money-mongering ways that Tony (Downey Jr.) wants so badly to be rid of after considering (and witnessing) the human cost. 
We get a bit of romantic/sexual tension, too, in the form of Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow, Proof), Tony Stark's life secretary. The drop-dead gorgeous dress that Potts wears to a dance and the subsequent almost-kiss make for some of the best tightly wound scenes between a man and woman within a comic-book-to-film venture.
Another huge plus for the film is the amazing CGI. Never once will the audience believe they aren't watching real life. This is, in part, thanks to Downey Jr.'s incorporation into these scenes as he tries and often fails to get his Iron Man suit off the ground. It's also hilarious to watch Tony Stark admonish his robotic gadgets as they try to help him but, more often than not, hurt him in some way (by spraying him with a fire extinguisher, for example, even though there's no fire).
I also really enjoyed the perfectly timed dialogue: 
Stark: "Okay, seriously, I feel like you're driving me to court martial. This is crazy. What did I do? I feel like you're gonna pull over and snuff me. What, you're not allowed to talk? Hey, Forest..."
Jimmy: "We can talk, sir." 
Stark: "Oh, I see. So it's personal. Alright."
Ramirez: "You intimidate them, sir."
Stark: "Good god, you're a woman! I honestly couldn't have called that. I mean, I would apologize, but isn't that what we're going for here? I thought of you as a soldier first."
Ramirez: "I'm an airman."
Stark: "Well you actually have excellent bone structure there. I'm having a hard time not looking at you now. Is that weird?"
This kind of snappy dialogue is sprinkled throughout the film and keeps the viewer laughing and interested the entire length of the movie.
Plenty of times movie-goers have seen films with a lot of action and no substance, but Iron Man happily -- and easily -- gives us both. It's well-deserving of the title "blockbuster." And if you really want to see what lay ahead for Iron Man, please stay til after the credits have finished rolling. You'll be exceptionally pleased if you do.

This graphic novel is one of the best novels I have ever read.  The non-linear story telling keeps things moving and it never gets dull.
With every page comes a new twist to the story, but no cliff hangers.  Everything is wrapped up in the end and makes sense.
Even if you are not a fan of comic books, you could easily get sucked into the Watchmen Universe.

So far I am quite pleased, although I am still experimenting with its use and operation.  Can't understand why when the videos are emailed, many complain that they can't be opened.  Still trying to ascertain whether this is the fault of the email service of the recipient, or a problem with my mailing.  Still learning the unit, but if it does all I expect it will, I'll be quite happy.  Ask me again in a couple of months.

Just got my B-40 elite and I love it. We have the largest office version at work, and it is awesome. I was a little scepticle that the B-40 would seem "cheap" compared to the office version, but I was pleasantly surprised. This machine seems to very nicely designed and built. I would have to say it weighs around 30 lbs. I have owned probably a dozen different coffeee makers of all types and brands and they always seemed flimsey and cheaply made. Not the Keurig - very nice. 
As for the operation it is awesome. Super easy to use and very convenient, since there is virtually no clean up. The machine I got has two sizes. The large size fills a standard coffee mug right up to the top. I like having the option of the small size, if I am in the mood for a really strong cup.
As for the coffee, I rate it very high. This makes great coffee and the variety is tremendous. In my opinion the Senseo makes a better cup of coffee, but the Keurig is not far behind, and the Keurig outshines the Senseo in ease of use and clean-up. I had lots of problems with the Senseo machines as well. My hope is that the Keurig gives me 1-2 yrs of use.
I definately recommend this machine - you won't be disappointed.

We love the fondue pot.  Love the sharp chrome look.  The only drawback is that the inside is harder to clean without teflon.  Leftover cheese or chocolate just slid off the teflon in our old Rival Fondue pot.

Picked this up after my old Netgear router was making a high-pitched whine and I had had it with my Airport Express' constant dropped signals.  I then proceeded to wait to intall it because of all the warnings about the complicated set-up.  When I finally did get around to it, it went VERY smoothly.  There's a decent "wizard" in the included software that I think got everything working in a matter of minutes.  It would be nice if they included printed instructions, but the electronic manual on the CD is pretty good and helped me sort out a little confusion I had (that was of my own making - the wizard had actually set everything up properly).
My system: Cable modem, one wired desktop computer, one wi-fi laptop, one Airport Express (for streaming music to my stereo), and a wi-fi iPod touch.
The ONLY difficult part of the setup was the Airport, but that was the fault of that device, not the router (I couldn't reprogram it for the new network remotely, so I had to re-set it and reprogram it over ethernet).  Now I get ZERO dropout, not even the microwave interferes with the music stream.
The router is silent and the lights are a cool and un-annoying blue.  I live in a Brooklyn apartment building and it serves up a great signal even out to the elevator.  On the flip-side, there's plenty of security options so my neighbors are hopefully not snooping on my network.
I have not tried the USB port, but am looking forward to using it for serving up media to my yet-to-be-purchased netbook.  I will update this when I do.

Now that I have been able to toast and poach simultaneously, I can now go to my maker with a feeling of completion.  No longer needing to fear those "repetitive and harrowing transitions from awakening, dressing, and travelling to work" mornings.
I wanted to mix peanut butter with an egg and see how that goes, but when I read a previous review about dripping sausage grease, I realized that I didn't yet have the Mr. Bento Stainless-steel Lunch Jar or the recommended vacuum and revolving pizza maker to make my experience complete.
Fortunately for me, we bought this lovely item for about 50 cents at a thrift store to benefit people needing hospice care.
Promise your loved ones that you will only get them this item as a gift if you know that they drive through McDonalds more than four times a week.  And if you do, well don't worry, because I will be sending my friends to thrift stores across the country trying to find more of these enticing items that was so ingeniously designed to maximize my cooking ability and save my last remaining vestiges of sanity that haven't been stomped on by some 30-something marketing major.

This is by far one of the best laptops ever made by Apple, in terms of design, ergonomics, and performance. If you are a programmer or need to type a lot, you will soon realize that the keyboard on these machines are incomparably better than the new aluminum unibody MacBook Pros. The non-glare LCD screen is also much nicer to work when there are background lights. I simply cannot stand the glare on the new shiny screen. I hope Apple soon realizes that the shiny screens, although higher in contrast, are not preferred by most professional users.

This review is from: The Princess Bride (Special Edition) (DVD)
      
The first thing I have to say is 'If you've seen the movie you've read the book.'  That is how closely they are related.  But still, If you've enjoyed this movie-no questions asked-read the book!  It's perfect for all ages and a good read aloud book as well.  It has everything the movie has and more background on each of the characters too.  But anyways, this movie is really fun and I have proudly made it a part of my DVD collection.  This movie will catch the intrest of a variety of age groups-and if you are a teacher it is a good movie to share with your class weather it's 2nd grade or 8th (I remember my 8th grade science teacher giving us a break and showing it to us.)   So there you have it-Watch the movie-read the book and live happily ever after.

In our household, you couldn't go to the bathroom, brush your teeth, or just comb your hair in front of the mirror without one of our two Siamese mutts jumping up and asking for a "Sink Drink."  Usually, both Reese and Heather had to have a turn at the faucet.  
Getting them their own fountain allows us to use our sink mostly on our own and gives all four of our feline family fresh water all the time.  Reese, who likes the water straight from the fountain, will drink at the most aerated top of the stream, while his sister Heather drinks near the bottom.  
Getting your cats to drink fresh, clean water daily keeps them healthy.  The fountain reduces having to deal with bowls.  Cleanup is easy and the animals are well worth it.
NOTE:  the filters are pretty common size pool filters, which you can get cheaper at the aquarium store!

I have owned many different bread machines, and still do.  The Zojirushi, the Panasonic and the Breadman Ultimate.This Zojirushi is becoming my favorite!It turns out great tasting, great looking loaves of bread every time.And the sourdough starter cycle does wonders.My only complaint is that the pan is not very nonstick.  You have to shake it pretty hard to get the bread out.  But big deal - as long as it comes out I'm happy!As far as Zo's customer service, I've never had any trouble.  I have called them to order spare parts for my rice cookers, and to order a spare pan for this bread machine in case I ever need it.  By spare parts I mean just that - spare.  I have not had any defects.  I just like having a spare pan etc on hand in case one gets scratched.  No trouble getting them on the phone, no trouble with my order.  I have absolutely no complaints.  Zojirushi makes great, innovative products and you should not hesitate to get this machine.

Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush with SanitizerI have owned Philips Sonciare toothbrushes before and always liked them.  This one is the best so far.

I purchased this external drive to connect to the USB 2.0 port on the back of Apple's Airport Extreme router for purposes of using the router's Airdisk feature and use OS X 10.5.3 to treat that volume as a Time Machine vault (this feature was disabled before 10.5.3).  I chose this particular drive because it did not require an additional power source, which was a big plus for me since I am running out of outlets where my router is located.  It's also one less wire to have to deal with.  I also chose this item because it seemed small, and I was happy when I first saw it because it was smaller and lighter than I expected.
Before I connected it to my Airport Extreme, I connected directly to my MacBook's USB port and formatted it as a Mac OS Extended (Journaled) disk with Disk Utility.  This also removed the Windows applications that were preloaded onto the disk.  After setting up the disk with the Airport Extreme and Time Machine, I was up and running beautifully.
My only complaint about this product is the packaging.  The drive comes in one of those difficult to open plastic packages that you'll spend 10 minutes trying to open.  If I had a strong razor blade or box cutter around, it would have been no problem.

You have heard it all with almost 2000 reviews but I'll put my 2 cent in also. I love the extra security clip. I always have trouble with them falling off my waistband. With this the extra tap keeps it from hitting the ground. I have killed countless ones that way.
Also knowing how many aerobic steps out of your total is good. All in all it is an encouragement to see the number of miles and steps and calories burned.
The only con is getting the battery in, I did so without too much trouble but then got interupted and when I got back to set the time I couldn't without taking the battery out and starting again. You have to do it right away. The battery compartment screws off with a tiny phillips screwdriver if you have trouble seeing small things that can be an issue.

This is a great router for a college student.  The signal is just as fast as when I'm plugged into the wall. It's small and out of the way, and when in the right place, it can go through apt walls to all my rooms.  It was very easy to set up, and it has enough advanced settings to keep my signal very safe.  I named my signal something obscure, disabled the SSID broadcast so it doesn't appear on wardrivers' lists, and instead of an old WEP password, I use the WPA, which is supposedly faster, more secure, and old systems can't even use it.  I can even limit the MAC address of the users to just me or visitors.  With such a small footprint and great features, I love this router.

My husband purchased two of these for our 3 cats about a year or so ago. I was hopeful it would help break his aversion to kitty detail. 
It is a wonderful concept -- roll and dump. I found the boxes easy to put together and operate. However, all of this is well and good provided your cats will tolerate a covered litter box. I've had to learn the hard way, after cleaning innumerable puddles of urine from the floor, that my oldest not only dislikes one box covered, but demands ALL boxes be uncovered.
Some other considerations for this product:
- Periodic cleaning is more complicated than a standard box since you have to dissemble to wash out all the nooks on the sifter. 
- Previous reviewers discussed litter amounts ... there is no need to fill more than a standard 2-3 inches. Any higher volume and the sifter gets a bit overwhelmed.
- I've experienced a small leakage of litter when rotating, I'm guessing a small warp in the plastic is to blame. This problem is worse if you overfill the pan, perhaps because of the excess weight.
- Most importantly to those complaining about clean litter in the cup ... follow the arrows on the top -- there is a right way and a wrong way to rotate.
- The large boxes are HUGE, so note the measurement before buying.
Unfortunately, through no fault of the product, I am back to manual scooping. This isn't the end of the world, except I am the only household resident with a strong enough stomach to perform the task (well except the dogs, but I can't abide by their methods of disposal).

There has been at least one review that highlighted some of the sexual scenes in the film. To respond to that reviewer, the film was rated PG-13, not G or even PG. Furthermore, don't get me started on why foul language/moderately graphic violence or other behaviors are allowed and tolerated in most big budget Hollywood films that ARE aimed at children! After all, this is a review of Iron Man. Most people who didn't 'get' Robert Downey's portrayal of Stark didn't ever read the original comics, or if they did, forgot much of what they read. 
Let's not forget that Tony Stark was the original rich, womanizing, misogynistic playboy who had an epiphany steering him onto a new course in life. I didn't all of a sudden go from a hard drinking, cigar smoking playboy to a Priest, but he DID change his ways. This was portrayed by Downey almost flawlessly.  To categorize this as a flawless performance would be difficult because movies about superhero characters lend themselves to so much broad interpretation from long time comic fans, to casual readers, to those who dismiss comics as 'kid stuff'.
At it's heart, IM was a great movie that happened to be about a superhero. I'm glad that the movie wasn't action top to bottom. This made the action sequences more enjoyable, and highlighted the acting prowess of the great cast (how'd they get Gwyeneth Paltrow to sign on at Potts?!) I for one look forward to IM 2, but I'm less anticipatory of the Avengers...I mean look at the X-Men franchise!

I have found that this quart yogurt maker produces more consistent yogurt than the model which contains individual glass cups.  I cover mine with a tea towel to reduce drafting or changes in the exterior temperature and it has always rewarded me with delicious yogurt.  My usual recipe includes low fat or skim milk but I add dry nonfat milk for extra creaminess and I like the yogurt more tart, so I tend to incubate it for the longer time.  Rather than start with a powdered starter, I buy the greek style full fat yogurt from Trader Joe's (similar to Greek Fage yogurt) and reuse a bit of the homemade yogurt for the next batch.  I do begin with a new purchased yogurt every 6 to 8 weeks just to freshen things up.  This also produces yogurt which makes excellent yogurt cheese which is similar to a cream cheese consistency by straining it over cheesecloth in a fine mesh strainer in the refrigerator for a couple days.  Be sure to place this over a bowl and check the bowl regularly since the liquid will fall quickly from the yogurt.  I often use the whey in recipes, too.

I didn't give it a 5-star because it doesn't always fold up easy (when you fold it up you really have to squish all the air out) so most of the time I don't velcro it up closed. I get a lot of compliments on the colors.

I first received a Sonicare toothbrush several years ago. It was a gift from a dental hygienist friend, and it was the Sonicare Elite e7300. I used the brush every day for about five years until it finally died, due to the button which turns it on finally wearing out completely.
I have nothing but praise for the Elite e7300, but I now use the Essence 5300. I have been using the Essence 5300 for about two months and I have not noticed any differences in quality or effectiveness between the two brushes. The Elite e7300 had additional features such as a LED battery indicator and a 30 second interval on beeps (which helps you to distribute time spent brushing among the four sections of your teeth), but while those features are useful they aren't something that I even really care about or miss having.
Anyhow, the Sonicare toothbrushes clean incredibly well. I cannot go back to regular toothbrushes now. The difference is like night and day. The Sonicare brushes clean extremely thoroughly, if used properly, and my teeth feel as though they have been polished after brushing. I had a little bit of plaque buildup before using the Sonicare, but after about two weeks of using the brush regularly the plaque buildup eroded, and after about a month my teeth were noticeably whiter.
Since using the Sonicare brushes I have not had a single cavity or any periodontal problems. The first time I went to the dentist after getting my Sonicare it almost felt like I wasted money on my appointment, because the hygienist barely had anything to clean. I used to go to the dentist every six months, but I feel the brushes are so effective at cleaning that I now go to the dentist every year and a half to two years. The brush has paid for itself by keeping me free from periodontal problems and allowing me to stretch out the time between teeth cleanings.
No, I am not a shill. The brush really is that good.

[[ASIN:B00009OY9U Logitech Extreme 3D Pro Joystick (963290-0403)]
I have had the stick about a week now and am very happy with it. Though I do have to learn not to over control in FS9 especially when flying the Extra 300 wow that thing's quick to pitch or roll. All in all though once I turned down the sensitivity I am able to control and land easily in all but the Extra and I am sure that is I not the joystick. The Throttle is better than any other joystick I have had since starting flight simming back with FS98 I would also like to mention that my computer is older and its slower frame rates effect how fast the joystick reacts and makes it easy to over control the airplanes.

I love gadgets, (intelligent ones) that is. The Ipod Touch is an intelligent gadget, and this Amazon seller had a very competitive price.  Although, I'm satisfied to use just itunes and mail (came in handy last few weeks when I was in the Caribbean on vacation) features for now, there are other great apps that I'll explore later. I'm over 50, and with so much to think about I like gadgets uncomplicated, so I appreciate the graphic interface which means you can figure things out logically. It took only a  short while for me to learn to lighten my touch to use it and my son taught me how to "pinch and zoom" to read articles on the internet and to view photos - so neat! I look forward to learning other tricks. With all the other features I'm NOT using yet, I'm under utilizing mine right now, but I still enjoy it. I bought the DLO case to protect it from fingerprints and scratches, and I invested in a good pair of headphones, for long waits or flights. If you love gadgets like I do, you'll enjoy this one.

I've got a confession to make, and I'll say it right here so there's no doubt about it: Before "Watchmen," I had never read a graphic novel.  I remember, as a boy, my mother purchasing me a comic book (or two, if I was exceptionally good, which I really tried to be) from the local grocery store.  I think I collected a grand total of ten.  They never really moved me.  They never interested me, until later, after I gained a bit more literary experience.  Now in my early 20's, I noticed a lot of my friends enjoy comics and graphic novels; I decided that I should give them a try as well.  All this being said: I shall not judge "Watchmen" as a graphic novel, for I am not qualified to do so.  But being an avid reader of novels, short stories, essays, nonfiction, poetry, and song lyrics, I shall judge "Watchmen" as a work of literature.  And the verdict?  A masterpiece.
1985 in some alternate universe, where Nixon is still president (dear God), we won the Vietnam War (not as great as you might think), and superheroes were once part of American culture.  Spurred by comic books, ordinary men and women took up costumes and monickers, patrolling the streets of their cities.  Some of them even united together.  But, in 1985, the only operative superheroes are those sponsored by the government: like Doc Manhattan, once a man, now possessed of indescribable capabilites; and the Comedian, a rough and tumble anti-hero (I hesitate to include "hero" at all) who has just been murdered.
Rorschach, a masked vigilante who was once a hero and is now wanted for murder, investigates.  He sees a disturbing pattner.  A "mask killer"--someone out to kill superheroes.  Teaming up (if somewhat reluctantly, on their behalf) with retired heroes the Nite Owl (II) and the Silk Spectre (II), he sets out to investigate what happened, uncovering a conspiracy to rival all conspiracies, one that may just lead to World War III...
Ah, okay.  Obligatory plot summary out of the way.  It doesn't begin to cover it; "Watchmen" is so layered with subtext and imagery, a mere summary of the novel's surface plot is almost an indulgent excess.  Let me just say this: Alan Moore is a paranoid but fantastic writer, and Dave Gibbons is a gifted (and slightly disturbed, all for the better) illustrator.  I could not put "Watchmen" down; I had the fortune to read it while I was sick (and thus equipped with a dandy of an excuse to skip class).  I'm not sure it made me feel any healthier...in fact, much to the contrary...but it inspired me to delve deeper into this literary medium.  I'm not sure if anything I read from now on will stand up to "Watchmen;" I can only say that I thoroughly enjoyed my forray into this twisted and cruel (and utterly realistic) world, and that I am a wiser and more cautious person for it.

I had just about given up hope for a deshedding tool until I purchased this product. I had previously bought, owned and discarded several tools that purported to end shedding to no avail. This product definitely cuts down on the shedding by at least 50% and my dog (a husky) falls asleep during the grooming. The only issue is that this product would need blade replacement, and the blades are expensive... Also there aren't any instructions on when or how to replace one when the time comes.

Zymox Otic With 1.0% Hydrocortisone 1.25 Oz Bottle
We have five poodles, Standard, Miniature, and Toy, all with the same problem, chronic ear infections.  Desperate and going broke over all the vet trips, we discovered Zymox Otic a year ago.  We bought the 8 oz bottle  because we have so many dogs.  This stuff is magic!!  It has completely cured all of our dogs.  We now only have to use it once a week, just to clean out the ears and keep them infection free, and when they come from the groomers, which was always the start of a new infection before Zymox.  Our vet wanted to know how we cured them and we told him about Zymox, he never heard of it. Now we tell everyone who has dogs, if the are prone to ear infections, get Zymox and save both your dogs and your money!!
P.S.  It worked so well on the dogs that when my husband was up one night with an ear infection himself, he figured, why not? It fixed him right up!! (I'm not saying people should use dog medicine, just saying my husband did and it worked).

Good Stuff:
-It was easy to set up, although, I'm very comfortable with computers.
-I get very cheap international rates.
-Very good sound quality (I have 5Mbits upload though)
Not So Good Stuff:
-When I first called them about moving my Verizon phone number to Ooma, the guy wasn't friendly, and he didn't have an answer to one of my billing questions.
-Moving my phone number from Verizon was supposed to take about 3 weeks. Almost a month went by and then I get an email about it. They haven't even started yet. This email was their first attempt at moving my number over. In the email they referred to an attachment that they forgot to attach. However, once I sent them some information they needed in that attachement, it took exactly 3 weeks to get service. 
Conclusion:
No monthly bills, great voice quality, cheaper international. My mother prefers the caller ID and voicemail of Ooma to the ones of Verizon. I docked it one star because the customer service experience detailed here. However, my family loves it and I fully recommend this.

I can't believe I'm raving about a litter box, but I am. I've raved about this to my husband, to my friends, on my blog... to everyone who'll listen, as a matter of fact. I have a kitten whose rather finicky about litter box hygiene, and a large house -- which means I need more than one litter box. I thought to replace one of our litter boxes with this, leaving the ol' 'covered box' as his main one.
Well, my kitten apparently has other plans. He's stopped using the others, so now I'm ordering two more just like this.
This litter box is SO easy to clean:
1. Keep 3" of clumping litter in it at all times. Refill as needed.
2. Shake the box vigorously after cleaning to "level" the litter.
3. To clean, roll the box upside-down on the round side. 
4. Return the box to rightside up. 
5. Remove the drawer and dump the drawer's contents.
That's IT. The top is secured with very firm clasps to ensure the litter doesn't go flying everywhere when you roll it, and the hole in front is not only large enough for big kitties, but also for you to add litter using a jar if you don't want to have to remove the box's lid.
Seriously, it's worth the money. You'll never mind cleaning the litter box again. That, my friends, is PRICELESS!

I finally received my LaCie hard drive. This is a well made piece of equipment - it has a solid, heavy construction and an elegant appearance.
I was relieved that the light is a pleasant shade of blue and is not bright at all, unlike other hard drive lights with blindingly bright LEDs.
This drive is not silent, though it is fairly quiet. I can clearly hear the drive running from several feet away but it's not disturbing. The fellow who said that he can't hear it with his ear right next to it, well the drive must not have been running at that moment.
I'm using this as a Time Machine backup drive. With a Firewire 400 connection to my old G5 iMac, it backed up 270 GBs in under 5 hours. At first the Time Machine backup was dog slow. Then I remembered to turn off my virus software, AND most important, I changed the Spotlight preferences by selecting the Privacy tab and adding my backup drive to prevent Spotlight from indexing/searching it. After that the backup process just flew!
After writing data for 5 hours the drive was warm, but not hot. The aluminum heat-sink case seems to cool the drive very well.
Eventually I will attach it to an Apple Airport Extreme via USB to use it as a network drive for wireless use by my laptop as well. Unfortunately the Airport Extreme wireless router does not provide a Firewire 400/800 connection - just ethernet or the much slower USB 2.0. I'll provide an update on the performance at that time.
All in all, I am quite happy with this purchase.

I had the CH yoke before this one and I just want to say that this one is better in a lot of ways.  It feels better and it seems to be well made just look at the big metal bar.

This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)
      
Once again, Stephenie Meyer has captured and enhanced my imagination in this novel, somehow managing to make me think everything in this book truly happened. Now, I'm no sap, so don't judge me, but I guarantee you will /cry/ in this book. At least one time.
Either that or become extremely depressed.
Keep a phone handy for the end of Chapter 3, so you can blubber out your misery to a friend, that's all I'll say.
But beyond that, let me mention that I read this 563-page-long book in a grand total of six hours. Every page is as awesome as the last, if not better, and though Bella may seem like a wuss most of the book, don't be turned off. The ending is phenomenal.
Hell, the book is phenomenal. All I can say is that for anyone who's read Twilight and loved it as much as me, you have GOT to buy this book.

THIS IS NOT A SCI-FI SHOW. Okay, technically it is. But the people who label it as sci-fi and dismiss it out-of-hand are missing out on one of the best dramas on television. And the people who can't forgive it for not being the hokey original series are missing out as well. Everybody needs to stop bringing their preconceived notions to the show and just let it be what what it is: a thought-provoking, nail-biting, well-planned and -written, supremely entertaining drama.

I learned to assemble and dissassemble it readily right away, and have been thrilled at the ability to QUICKLY and efficiently juice everything I've thrown at it. The chute is wide enough to accommodate large pieces of fruit and many whole fruits and vegetables. It is easy to clean and parts can go into the dishwasher.

I previously had a Linksys WRT54G and was moderately satisfied with it until it started exhibiting signs of 'cheapness', like general flakiness, inability to load the web management (it'd load a blank screen), etc.  After getting frustrated enough, and desiring a router with gigabit ports, I started searching, until I came across the DIR-655.
The first best part (and there's more than one) of this router was unpacking it.  Honestly, it's the sexiest networking device I've seen in a long while.  There's a button hiding stealthily on the right side, if you take note, but no mention is made of it in the manual.  Also included in the package is a little black plastic stand, so you can stand the router on end - that's pretty standard for D-Link, and I like that.  They threw in a Cat-5 cable, was that a joke?  What am I going to do with a Cat-5 cable on a gigabit router?  That's very amusing.
I elected not to run the software included on the CD.  There's no real need if you know what you're doing.  However, for more advanced users I'd recommend connecting the router to your computer, but NOT connecting to your internet connection (cable modem), and just spending a few minutes familiarizing yourself with your new sweet toy and all of her options.
Now for the good stuff:  This router is amazing!  The main 'Setup' page is basically divided into 2 parts for each section, a 'wizard' for quick-and-easy setup, and a 'manual' page.  Basically, if you're a beginner, stick to the wizard pages.  If you wanna get up and running fast, go through the wizards, you can always go back later and manually tweak the settings to your liking.
Connectivity is top level.  I tested it by transferring 25 GB of large files then 25GB of small files between two hosts connected to this router, both using 10 feet of cat6 each.  100% success, no packets lost, no fragmentation, and the transfer was about 4% faster than the same transfer straight through on an unmanaged gigabit switch.  Internet connectivity was great too.  Thanks to the built-in SPI firewall, all the 'network noise' (thanks to all the other 'dirty' hosts on comcast's network) is effectively eliminated, and honestly speeds up my internet activity significantly over what I'm used to when using the WRT54G.  Checking the logs revealed the dirty details of all this crap that's filtered out, and I like it gone.
Wireless-N connectivity was also good.  Not much can be said here, it works like it should, and I have no complaints.
Administration is also very nice.  As usual, the router is administered via browser, and while that's cool, I'd also like to be able to ssh into it and take care of business via CLI, but alas that is not to be.  But otherwise, the web management is well designed, fast and easy to understand.  This router also checks periodically for firmware updates and notifies you via email if you have the email settings enabled.
Other items of note: VoIP works flawlessly, as does all online gaming that I tried.  Latency is noticeably reduced (on my favorite server, from about 80ms to about 60ms avg) in Half-Life 2 deathmatch.  torrents worked fine.  So far I have no real complaints about this router.  It's now my most favorite part of my network.
Overall, I give this 5/5.  Honestly, I'd easily say it's worth the price I paid for it (at the time it was $140), and for my network it is a perfect match.  If you're a 'normal' computer user, don't buy this just to impress your friends; the features and complexity would be lost on you and are not worth the price.
PROS:
-DHCP Address Reservation
-Easy administration
-Quick Setup
-Email logs
-Incredibly easy port forwarding and per-application settings
-SPI + NAT + WPA2.  Nuff said.
-Great documentation and help files.
-Port forwarding scheduling.
CONS:
-No SSH or CLI administration.
-Reboot required after changing most settings.
-No matching high quality D-Link cable modem to go with this.
Congratulations, D-Link, on crafting yet another incredible piece of networking equipment.  The DIR-655 is worthy enough to sit on my desk, instead of crammed behind it like the Linksys was!

We have this same model, and bought one for a friend that was leaving middle Georgia to go to Colorado.  She loved the coffee maker, so we bought her one to remember us by.  My wife and I love "strong" coffee, and we've found several that are "bold" enough to make a "full" cup of coffee.  Most of the flavored coffees (great in the late afternoon as a "pick-me-up) we use, we select the smaller cup size so that we can enjoy the full flavor.  This is a great product, and Amazon is one of the better places (price wise) to buy the coffee too!

This review is from: Beverly Hills Chihuahua [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)
      
Months before it's release, I saw the first trailer that was released. It knocked my socks off! This was a huge production number reminicent of the Busby Berkeley numbers from the Thirties films. The computer work on lip-sync and facial expressions were very natural and the music fell into place beautyfully. I waited for the films  release October 3rd. and was not dissapointed.  The big thing I did miss in the release was that they did not use the production that was used in the first trailer.  Now I wait for the DVD release,and pray they include that first trailer as a "bonus feature" in the DVD release. I have touted this film to many of my friends, and most agree as to how funny, cute, exciting,etc it is.  I would also be interested in seeing a "how it was made" feature.  I now wait for the DVD.

I've been using Alli now since the middle of November, and I've lost 12 pounds, on schedule with the promised 1-2 pounds of safe weight loss per week.  They have a very robust online support site for people who purchase the pills and it provides useful tracking of weight loss and encouragement in more ways than I can use.  The treatment effects that you read about are what keeps people honest with Alli and essentially make it work -- if you eat too much fat at one sitting, you'll be visiting the bathroom quite frequently.  You learn quick.  I made it through the holidays with continued weight loss, which I view as an amazing feat.  I have 13 more pounds to lose on my plan and I'll weigh what I did before I had my two kids.  Easy to use, promotes healthy eating habits and lifestyle changes, and self-critiquing when you stray from the plan.  I would recommend Alli to others -- it's a little pricy but I'm getting my money's worth out of it.

You may not need this expensive version of TurboTax if you're buying it primarily because you also have investment income (Schedule D). I realize TT has recommended this but they've recanted and told me that the 2008 Deluxe version will be every bit as capable as the 2007 Deluxe version was in guiding us through the Schedule D, C, SE and other self employment forms.
Here's the dialogue:
TurboTax support has been extremely responsive in calling me back regarding my complaint to them about how badly they're confusing people on which TT product to buy.
I'd like you to read my question to them and then their answer. The bottom line is that TTDeluxe 2008 is every bit as comprehensive (and more) as the TTDeluxe 2007 product. There are no takeaways and no real reason for a Schedule D user to have to buy the Premiere version and no significant reason why a self-employed person MUST buy the Home/Business version. He knew their company screwed up and caused a public relations nightmare. Apparently the "recommended" upgrade products have expanded guidance and help for the uninitiated TT user.
If this 2nd review of mine is not accepted by Amazon, I will try to post it to the Premiere version and the Home/Business version and also as a comment to my 1st review here.
My question:
Considerable confusion exists as to whether a person with investment income/transactions or self employed income absolutely needs to buy the considerably more expensive Premiere or Home/Business version. Your website indicates that the Deluxe version "includes" forms Sched. D, Sched. C, SE etc. and yet you say we should buy the more expensive program. This doesn't make sense. I'll be happy if Deluxe 2008 is as comprehensive as Deluxe 2007 was but nowhere do you compare the 2008 and 2007 versions. 
You are getting very bad reviews this year on Amazon because of all this confusion. People believe you are taking away function from Deluxe and raising the price to boot. 
Their response:
"These are the actions we took to assist you in resolving your issue:
I was able to express to Sam that the Deluxe program will have the same functionality as in previous years, as well as additional features as well. Sam express his confusion on the product features and that of the comparison between each of the verison of TTax. I informed Sam that he has given me a great piece of reference when relaying the changes, functions, and ease of usage within the program. 
I will be able to inform my supervisors on this as well as urge the response for our return customers, as well as new.
Thank You Sam."

They are soft and chewy, not like the leathery texture I'd come to expect from this type of snack.  It's nice to have the flavor variety pack.  None of the flavors are the "bad" one that everyone leaves until last.  We just reach into the box and pick out whatever comes out.
Our whole family enjoys these.  In fact, I think mom and dad eat more of these than the kids do!  They are consistently gone in much less than a month, such that I'm considering increasing our subscription order from 1 to 2!

We love this coffee/espresso one-cup master!  The only thing that sucks is that much of machine is made from wack plastic - the kind that leaches crap into your water.  We make sure that we don't let water sit in the plastic water reservoir - empty it out each time.
Also, EVIL are the producers of the plastic one-time-use deals that you can buy in ridiculous bulk.  Instead, BUY YOUR OWN BEANS (we get ours at Trader Joe's), grind em and get a reusable gold filter at Bed Bath and Beyond or Walmart, to name two retailers.  You can prob get one here on Amazon as well!

This product has served me just fine. I have experienced no problems with this switch, and I am certainly glad that I got this because I have a computer on 10Mb (instead of 100Mb), and I would not want that one computer to slow all the others down. It seems a little overpriced for what it does, but as a product, its performance has been optimal.

This is an excellent show. The writing, directing, acting, production, everything is superb! It is extremely well crafted(I love the handycam space dogfights!), the plot is better, the continuity is better, the character development is better, the acting is better, the directing is better than the original 70's series. If you consider yourself a snob when it comes to watching quality film, this will not disappoint you. Clearly, anyone criticizing this show is defending their childhood nostalgia generated from memories of the original. The only gripe I have about these/any TV show DVD season sets is how they always put the, "previously on Battlestar Galactica" scenes always at the beginning of each episode. You always have to fast forward over these to get to the start of the Episode, you cant just press the Next Chapter button on the remote, because you miss the beginning of the episode!(the part before the theme song intro, which is another annoying segment that is on every episode, strip both of these things off DVD sets! I only want to see the beginning intro once at the beginning of the set!) This is extremely annoying when you want to watch the whole thing seamlessly like one big mega 800 minute film. Which is the only way to ever watch these DVD season sets, pick a weekend, clear your schedule, and watch this epic fantastic adventure! There's one episode in season 2 that I'd dare to say is even better than Star Wars! and I'm a way bigger star wars fan than you are! But you have to start with season one! If you like Sci-Fi with Drama, Action and excellent acting stop reading this and buy this now! you wont regret it!

We've tried a few well-known brands of diapers and had terrible results.  It seemed like everyone that held our little boy got peed on.  So we decided to pay a little extra and try these swaddlers, and I must honestly say that the investment was well worth it! Since using these diapers he NEVER leaks through. He's dry and we don't have to change him right away if we're out shopping and he does his business. They contain it and keep him dry.  Couldn't be happier.  Too bad Pampers doesn't make them in bigger sizes.

I have waxed myself for years.  I became totally sick of the whole process; heat up the wax, get out the strips and the baby powder, blah blah blah - then you have the clean up...not to mention, if it was bad 'waxing day' it is totally possible that you bruised yourself in the process (I've done it).
So, based on the other reviews, I bought this little do-dad.  I freakin' love it!!!!  Personally I think it hurts way less than waxing!!!  You might be wondering 'where do you use it?'...answer, on my legs and bikini line - and I'm totally serious when I say that it hurts way less than waxing.  I use it about once a week or so, right after i get out of the shower.  It's quick and very effective - takes me less than 5 min to the job.  The light is awesome - the other folks were right when they told you that it really illuminates every little hair.  I guess it is a little loud, but frankly after dealing with wax - I'll put up with the sound of a little motor for the whole 5 min that i use it.  There is little to no clean up and I haven't had any issues with bumps or in-grown hairs.  If you are currently using wax and you are considering making the switch to an epilator I highly recommend this one.

This is an amazing product, if you can find it.  The OKC metro PetSmarts didn't even recognize the product although it is listed on their website.

In Az where we live its usually too hot to go out and grill, at least for me, so I ordered this grill thinking it would be the next best thing.  First I was surprised at how large it was, you can fix 6-8 hamburgers on it, 4-6 steaks, or whatever, its huge.  It does not smoke up the house.  Its just perfect, and I love it!!  I use it almost every other night since I got it.  I do not have to stand out in the heat, to enjoy my grilled food now.  The clean up is a bit more difficult because you do have to hand wash the grill, with an outside one, you do not, but to enjoy the fine grilled food we are having it is well worth it.  If your looking for a grill for the inside this is the one.  Remember it is large though, and finding a spot to store it away may be an issue, but I leave it on the counter, so that has not been an issue yet.

Overall this is nice product. If setup procedure would have been straightforward and if it would have started to work as prescribed in the start up CD, I would have given it 5 stars. For those, who are planning to purchase the product of this catagory, I would recommend go ahead with it, but DO NOT FOLLOW the procedure prescribed in CD for wireless connectivity. It would me MUCH simpler to just call Linksys Customer Care (You may need to call twise at toll free number(s)) and product will meet your expectations of wireless router...

Pampers swaddlers...Yes, they are expensive but you will go through less of them as they are far more absorbent than any of the leading brands. I like to think of them being "pharmaceutical grade" while other brands are "over the counter". Our newborn son had a butt rash for over two weeks, and after switching to swaddlers, within 2 days it was almost completely gone. We attribute this to the dry weave found in the diaper. It really, really works. Sure, the high cost might be eating into his college fund, but if it means Mommy and Daddy get to sleep for more than 3 hours at a time, it's worth it. Plus,  I'm sure this will pay off by not having to spend a small fortune at the plastic surgeon to remove premature aging from lack of sleep.  Give 'em a shot. You won't be disappointed.

I purchased this product to replace a coffee maker that I had bought about two weeks earlier that worked poorly. The price was a little higher than I had intended to pay but based on the reviews I purchased the coffee maker. I am pleased with the design and function. The carafe pours well (no spillage issues) and the coffee is hot and remains so after brewing. There is a  temprature control so you can set how warm/hot you want the coffee. There is a programmable 'auto off' feature so you set the time you want the coffee maker to shut off.

Decided to upgrade my video camera to take to Disney World.  Had an old Sony that worked great but just wasn't practical any longer.  Wanted a camera that was smaller, lighter and recorded in a digital format.  The HD camcorders are little expensive for me right now and are still fairly new to the consumer scene.  After reading may reviews around the web I decided to go with the Canon FS100 and I would have to say I am very pleased with the performance.  The camera has everything I was looking for and the quality of the video is very good.  Daytime video is better than nightime but that is to be expected.  Overall I am very happy with the my purchase and would recommend this camera.

<review id="1450" label="1">
A neat little camera that comes with a number of mounting options.
Its as simple as add the memory card fit the batteries and off you go.
You have to read the little booklet to ensure that you do the correct presses of the buttons on the camera to get the fuctions as the display only gives you short codes but to start and stop video is very easy.
I find the cards are better download away from the camera.
If you are using 2Gb cards as I was it does take some time to download from the camera using the cable transfer.
The picture quality was good for a 640 x 480 video at 30 fps, I personally have not tried the other resolutions as I have not seen the need.
The camera does not appear to have image stabalisation to avaoid shakes and so the video footage can give some wobble, changing where you mount the unit normally sorts this out.
The sound quality is not so good but with most action shots theres a lot of noise rather than soundtrack anyway.
The batteries last for about 1.5 hrs (I was using Duracell)
The sealing for use underwater makes the back a little stiff, but i would recomend using the lubricant on these seals at all times which makes the removal easier easier(sparingly or it gets messy)
For the price I have found it to be a good little unit for capturing some of the more unusual footage where you would not want to use a normal video camera.

I have had this oven about 4 months or so.  I have used it to toast bread, rolls, bagels, frozen waffles and to cook pizza and use it nearly everyday.  This oven is fabulous.

I was lucky to find this on the Friday Sale for a great bargain, but would pay full price now knowing how awesome this machine is.

It feels great, forming to how your hand naturally sits.  The rubber siding is fantastic compared to that of Razer's plastic that gets slick.  So far there has been 0 double clicks with a single mouse click, thumbs up there. Cursor speed and smoothness feels great.

Dr. Benjamin Cassuto, DVM (Banfield) recommended I give this to my cat with chronic cystitis. I sprinkle the powder into his food, and he doesn't even notice it (or doesn't mind if he does.) Although I can't know for sure how much of a role this is playing in his recovery maintenance (because he also had a course of antibiotics), at least he IS staying healthy. I believe the Cosequin is a contributor to his health at least.  (The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars, is because of inability to scientifically distinguish elements.)  I plan to continue with this product, since it appears to be helping him.  Thanks

after careful consideration &amp; tons of research, I bought this laptop direct from the hp website mostly because of the hard drive space &amp; the huge screen. I was a bit worried that i had gotten my hopes up too high but this product absolutely did not disappoint! This is the fourth laptop computer i've owned, the others being two ibms (one bought through my university, it imploded two months after the warranty ran out) &amp; an iBook that i absolutely hated. this computer is by far my favourite. It runs fast, quiet &amp; smooth &amp; the screen has such a brilliant picture! For school i use a lot of (allegedly) very high end computers for Computer Aided Design &amp; Illustration classes, &amp; honestly the picture on this notebook is a thousand times clearer than those more expensive machines. Vista has taken some time to get used to, but eventually i will adjust, just like i did when XP came out. This computer is an absolute steal. It's definitely the best $700 i've ever spent.

I have been thinking to buy this damn thing for a long long time. MacMall had a good deal with Bill-Me-Later. Also I recently set up a brand new Home Theater system. I connected the Airport Express to a wall socket closest to me HT, Connected it to my Onkyo 706 with a Y Analog cable and ran the setup utility. Since I already had a router, I connected router and airport wirelessly. That's it. Setup done !!! Got to iTunes and selected the Airport Express on the bottom as the output and songs started playing. Amazing!! Ok now the best thing - I was having dinner and didn't like the song that was playing. Took my iPhone out and opened "Remote" application and could change my songs on the fly! Now that is what I call a perfect setup. 
I am planning to hook it up with an optical Audio cable to my Onkyo. Hope that improves the quality of sound even more. Buy it if you don't have a Computer connected to your main entertainment/Music system. Highly Recommended !!

This review is from: Wall-E (Three-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy) (DVD)
      
At first I was skeptical about a movie with very little dialogue, hell I didn't even see it in theaters, because I thought it was going to be a stupid kid's movie and I accidentally saw it during the holidays when by younger cousins came over and I was wrong. The film plays out like a Chaplin movie (Gold Rush) as in the lovable loser falls for the cold, and distant person,this case a robot and eventually the love is reciprocated) crossed with 200l: A Space Odyssey. The film is about a lone robot: Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-class (WALLE)who looks like the offspring of Johnny Five and a trash compacter cleaning up the earth in the future after a Wal-martesque corporation run takes over the planet and runs it into the ground. Walle after 700 years alone evolves a personality and watches the hell out of Hello Dolly and he gets lonely and wants love. 
* This movie has tons of extras for both film geeks and kids. 
* Note: the DVD box is unique and not the standard 9/16In. by 5 3/8In for those that whine about that sort of thing, also its left and right side slide out oppose to opening like a book. 
* The movie is a hybrid of live action and top CG animation. Two Words: Fred Willard!Plus there an original song by Peter Gabriel! Wall-E (Three-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy)

The installation was a bit rocky at the start.  The "easy setup" CD simply did not work at all. It failed to detect the modem, although it was properly connected. So I called the 24/7 tech support, they answered with a message that said they had an unusually high volume of calls, and instead of queuing the call and asking me to wait, they told me to call back later and then actually disconnected me. Something's amiss in that call center. 
Steam was beginning to come out of my ears. I called back immediately and got right through to a very nice and very capable rep in India, who walked me through the manual setup flawlessly, and had all 4 of my various devices up and running perfectly in minutes.  In 7 days, I have experienced only one of the dreaded lock-ups requiring power-off-on reset. Seems to run faster than my old Buffalo, which had just suddenly decided to stop working. I had a pair of Buffalo units to cover the whole house, and this single unit at one end, where the cable comes in to my house, seems to be doing the same job. 
I have not tried to mix G and N yet, and I'm a little concerned about the review that said this is problematic.  I'll keep my fingers crossed, and report back when I get my N laptop.

Simply THE BEST---Betta than all the rest!  I don't know where to begin.  7-8 hours of battery power.  Very bright-clear 10.2 screen.  The volume "stereo speakers", though not as loud as full sized notebook computers---is acceptable for a 'netbook' in my opinion.  To be specific--a quality sound with a bit of bass---though not the loudest!  I purchased the Black colored netbook---which is very classy---with the silver ring around the perimeter of the machine.  I really like the LCD lights that appear on the bottom left side---which is unique vs. other netbook conputers.  Yes, while the top is glossy, it is a finger print haven---thus I keep a polishing cloth with me at all times as I'm most particulate.  The machine has a very sturdy-quality-sexy look! The speed in boot up exceeded my expectations.  This netbook is just on key--with blue-tooth (which the netbook computers in the $300 price range do not include blue-tooth and may not include a 6-cell battery.  By the way, the Samsung NC-10 does come with with a light weight suede type fold over-Samsung logoed case (you'll need something a bit more thicker and protective, trust me)*
I returned the ASUS Eee 1002HA----because of:
-Aluminized Casing was not necessarily all that impressive---still allowed for finger prints and was 'brown' in color.
-The relocation of the 'shift key' from the typical position--I found quickly annoying.
-The 2 cell battery bothered me----which was reported to allow 5 hours of usage as low-power
-Very low volume
As a self-acclaimed electronic geek-----please believe that the Samsung NC-10 is the BEST netbook out there!  Of the online reviews I've read, this netbook is rated the best----though it seems the Samsung NC-10 has a low key identity compared to the Acer, ASUS, HP and Dell.  
Yes, there are some top of the price line Netbook Computers out there that cost nearly $1000, but not sure they are necessarily better---and in my opinion if you're willing to pay $1000, why not just buy a 12.1 or 13.3 full notebook computer???!!!!
Fyi, I did find a Samsung DVD-R Burner online at Amazon for $79 that I purchased also.  
If you choose to go the Samsung NC-10, write a review as I'm most interested in your feedback.  
Have fun shopping on Amazon.com*

You simply cannot go wrong with this one.  Trust the reviews... this isn't a trick.

A better book than the first, this book introduces us to new characters that are delightful, funny and important to the story line. It deals with what happens when Edward did what he thought was the right thing - leaving Bella so that he can keep her safely out of a world that wants to kill her - and why that is such a mistake. Because their enemies still want her dead anyway! Bella sought comfort in her friendship with the adorable Jacob Black, a werewolf, and things get a little complicated. She is unwilling to let go of the friendship, but unable to will Jacob not to fall in love with her either. I especially enjoyed the Volturis. They are elegant, delightfully frightening and rife with secrets. A perfect ruling vampire coven! Oh, and Alice is the hero in this book. (Yay! she's my favorite character!) She came through in a big way for Bella, Edward and the survival of the Cullen family.
The only thing I would change is cut out some of Bella's moping. (We get it. She's extremely sad. Who wouldn't be?) And add in more Volturis! But other than that, I thought this was a richer, more compelling book than the first.

I used Turbo Tax for the first time this year.  I usually do our taxes by hand, but this was much easier and I didn't need to take over the kitchen table for an entire weekend.  I liked how I was able to leave the returns and come back later to resume where I'd left off.  I also liked how Turbo Tax uses the Federal return to populate the State return, making the State return extremely quick.  I never did figure out how to make a comparison between our liability as married joint and married separate, but I don't think it would have helped us this year.  I plan to use Turbo Tax again next year.

This the best coffee maker yet .. better then my old Krups and that made pretty good coffee.
Besides looking good on the counter, its easy to brew and the operate.  
Just wish the outside had the water level line, but thats not as important as the taste.  I got gift certificates to Dunkin Donuts for the holidays, and have not used them yet, now I can just buy the coffee and make it at home
love this coffee machine!!

Overall, it's a decent mouse. Definitely would recommend someone to try it out before buying it.
I have two peeves that make this mouse fall short of being great imo. The middle click isn't so great; it's not easy to push in like my old MX510. The second is the back and forward buttons are difficult to reach and don't feel easily accessible. They don't protrude enough so that you can feel where they are with your thumb. They're in an awkward location because the mouse is a bit smaller.
I miss the Scroll UP and Scroll Down buttons above and below the scroll wheel the old MX510 had but that can be overlooked. Sometimes the middle click to scroll around doesn't work properly for some reason. Like if I'm viewing a picture within windows and zoom in and try to navigate around it doesn't do it properly. It could be do to the fact that it has a scroll left and right button and the middle click is easily pressing those as you hold the middle click button down.
The size is definitely not for everyone and does take some getting used to. I use the precision grip with 2 x 7gram weights in the middle and it feels solid and nice. I had to get used to holding it near the back so that I can more readily access the forward and back buttons which is a bit weird.

this ice cream maker is easy to use and clean up - the only problem is that using whole milk, half-and-half, or real cream is very fattening, but it tastes so much better than what one gets at the market and the texture is excellent!  I have to watch myself and not get too carried away and also, give at least half of each batch away!

This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)
      
This is the second book in the Twilight Series. It is a fabulous read--keeps you on the edge of your seat. You'll be lusting after Edward or shall I say thirsting after him by the time you are done with this novel. Bella meets a new friend, Jacob, who keeps things very interesting as he is very different from Edward. Be sure to buy the third book, Eclipse, so you can start it right after you finish New Moon because the ending is a cliffhanger. I used 2 day shipping to get this book to me so I could start reading it ASAP!

I'd been waiting for these laptops since the introduction of Intel processors in Macs.  The MacBook Pros used nearly the exact same case design for far too long.  While I didn't think the MacBooks really needed a design refresh, I like the choices Apple made so much that I bought one.  I like having a smaller laptop, though I do appreciate some of the additional features you get with a MacBook Pro.  That said, many of the extra bells and whistles once left out of the MacBooks have found their way in and while I never really thought I'd care I have to say--it makes a huge difference.
Owning a new aluminum MacBook is a lot more like owning one of the old 12" Powerbooks.  I used to have one and it was wonderful.  It's probably the one discontinued Apple computer that's coveted by its owners.  Their resale value is still fairly high, considering how comparatively slow they are.  If you're a blogger or a writer and you don't use the machine for much else, it's sort of a best of breed.  However, with these new aluminum MacBooks I think things have changed.  You get a backlit keyboard in the higher end model (which is the one I'm reviewing), an aluminum body (of course), and a multitouch trackpad.  I think the backlit keyboard is the nicest addition.  It's really something you appreciate more once you've used it.  I've never had any difficulty typing in the dark but I can't see myself ever buying a machine without a backlit keyboard again.  It's incredibly helpful when you need to type a special character or press a function button.  If you don't have the usual key positions memorized, I imagine it's even better.  This makes the high end MacBook feel a lot more like a MacBook Pro.
Regarding the aluminum unibody Apple likes to talk about so highly, it's very nice.  While they did this with the Macbook Air, it seems much more refined with the new MacBooks and MacBook Pros.  My one complaint, which I feel will fade over time, is that it sometimes looks too perfect.  I don't mean this as a backhanded compliment, but that there is such a thing as being so perfect it lacks a human touch.  Think about listening to a computer play a song versus a human.  It's just not as good.  Well, technically the computer is better but that human touch is relevant to us.  This machine is so exact and precise that it sometimes feels inhuman.  At the same time, it is rather stunning.  I think I'll get past the lack of human imperfections as I get used to looking at it each day.
The multitouch trackpad is something I'm not foreign to, as I used a MacBook Air for awhile.  The new trackpad space is identical.  I found this very fortunate as I don't like buying new machines without being able to get a Marware Protection Pack as well.  Luckily I bought a MacBook Air pack and it fit perfectly.  Even the trackpad film fit.  While multitouch gestures didn't make their way into my regular routine too often, I did use them here and there and am glad they now exist throughout Apple's line of laptops.  The disadvantage of the new trackpad is the lack of a button.  Yes, the whole trackpad is a button and yes it's very clickable.  The problem is that sometimes the click doesn't register.  I turned on single and double taps for left click and right click (respectively), but sometimes those don't register as well.  If this were my first Apple laptop, I'd panic and run to the Genius Bar for help.  Since I've been through a few of these, I've found that it takes a month or two before you really break in the button.  I've had the laptop for about ten days now and it's already working better.  Still, I wish it just clicked as expected out of the box.  For those that are wondering how you click and drag if there's no actual button, you just kind of pretend there is a button.  While Apple gives you the entire trackpad for tracking, and you can click pretty much anywhere (with resistance building more and more as you move upwards), you can expect this trackpad to work just like the MacBook Air's trackpad.  The space where the Air's button would be is where you can safely rest a thumb (or whatever) for clicking.  It will not register as a second finger as easily.  If you pretend there is a button at the bottom of the trackpad, you'll quickly forget there isn't one.
But those are the bells and whistles.  As far as performance goes, there's not much excitement in regards to speed.  The computer's architecture has changed, but the Core 2 Duo processors aren't really much faster (or any faster as the case may be here).  The big jump is in the new graphics processor from NVIDIA.  I'm not going to pretend to be a hardcore gamer.  I don't play many games, and especially not when it comes to those that are GPU-intensive.  I can't give you frame rates from World of Warcraft or anything like that.  What I can tell you is that the new NVIDIA graphics make for smoother performance around the operating system and seem to contribute to 1) better battery life and 2) a cooler system.
One of my favorite things about this laptop is that it doesn't really get hot.  I ran an H.264 video encode today so I could put a video on my iPhone and it didn't feel hot at all.  The MacBook Air heats up in about five seconds and then cripples the GPU first, before throttling anything else, and gets pretty warm.  You could iron a shirt with the old MacBooks and I won't even start with the MacBook Pros.  I can't believe how cool this machine has been.  I'm not punishing it with endless work, but for it to make it through a twelve minute video encode without breaking a sweat is pretty amazing.  It's the first time I've used an Apple laptop and didn't worry about becoming sterile.  I don't know what they did, but it's wonderful.
I get about four hours of battery life under normal usage.  While this still doesn't quite match what Apple promises, it's the highest I've ever, realistically, gotten out of an Apple laptop.  I'm more than happy with four hours.  I rarely use my laptop off of the power adapter anyhow.
Another neat feature of the new MacBooks (and MacBook Pros) is that you can use your iPhone/iPod touch stereo headset with microphone to record (crappy) audio and have basic control over iTunes.  Since I swap my iPhone headphones out of the iPhone and into the laptop very frequently, this is fantastic.  I can't tell you how many times I've been interrupted and clicked the microphone on the headset to pause the song, only to remember that I can't.  Now I can.  This is wonderful.
So far I've only had good things to say and that's because, overall, this is an excellent machine.  I want to talk about a few bad things, however.  In my opinion, the biggest flaw is the display.  This is why I've rated it a four and not a five.  The display is an embarrassment.  If you have any intention of doing any visual work that actually matters, this machine will be completely useless to you.  The viewing angle is so terrible that no matter where you are, you will not get even contrast.  I don't notice it quite as much when I'm surfing the web or just writing, but when I watch a video it's very apparent.  If you do visual work and it's not just for fun, do not buy this machine.  Get a MacBook Pro where it's not an issue.  Even the old MacBooks have better displays.  I don't do visual work on this machine for that reason.  If it's not critical, I might, but for the most part I work on my desktop machine instead.
Another downside about the display is that it's glossy.  These look cool and all, but the reflections are obnoxious when you can't easily avoid them and you don't get very accurate color or contrast.  This is a fault of the panel itself, too, but the glossiness just ruins it further.  For general use, this isn't a big deal.  If you want to color correct or design, Apple has pretty much opted to screw you over regardless of how much you decide to spend on their hardware.  Matte screens are just not going to be an option anymore.  I think this is a stupid choice, because the people who kept Apple alive are the designers who chose Macs early on in Apple's history.  The loyalists are generally not fond of glossy screens and have been vocal about it.  I think having an option is fine, but forcing people to use glossy screens is awful.  Being a loyalist and needing a matte screen, I've just started using my laptop for everything but color critical work.  It's allowed me to prefer working on a smaller screen, which is nice because it means less computer to cart around.  I've been able to work around this problem, but my situation allowed for it.  It's still a big problem for a lot of people who can't defer to a desktop.
The other disadvantage is a lack of Firewire.  While I rarely employed Firewire in my laptops, especially after using the MacBook Air (which has none), I still liked having it around.  I don't really miss that it's gone.  Again, this is primarily due to having a desktop companion that can connect with just about anything.  Whether or not this is a major issue is really up to the individual.  If you know you need it, you have your answer.  Personally, I wish Apple would've kept it until they had something better to replace it with.  Maybe they couldn't fit it into the new, slimmer casing.  I would just like to see a USB 2.0 alternative, since USB 2.0 doesn't quite live up to its claims.
When it comes to upgrades and replacements, this machine gets a little better and a little worse.  If you're upgrading from a MacBook Pro to a MacBook Pro, you're getting easier upgrades all around.  If you're used to upgrades in a MacBook, however, I'd say things are better and worse.  If you want to replace RAM, you have to remove the bottom case.  It's not that hard to do but it means keeping track of quite a few screws and exposing the entirety of your machine's innards.  If you're simply replacing the hard drive, however, you can pretty much just yank it out.  One of the first things I did is replace the hard drive with a solid state disk.  They're getting cheaper and you can get a 120GB or 128GB drive for much less than what Apple offers.  But on the plus side, if you do want your computer to come with an SSD you now have that option as a custom order.  While in tests SSD hasn't really proven to have too many benefits, in real world practice it makes the machine feel much snappier.  For that reason, having an SSD is worth it.
Apple's RAM upgrade prices are also not as terrible as they used to be.  At least, it seems that way.  A RAM upgrade through a third party only saves $10-20.  When spending a lot of money on a new machine, I think many people would choose the convenience over the comparatively small savings that come with doing it yourself.
Anyway, that pretty much covers the majority of the relevant pros and cons of the new MacBook.  So far I love it.  I think it's a wonderfully made machine.  It's sturdy, it's attractive and it works really well.  I've very pleased with it and as long as you can handle the poor display, I highly recommend this MacBook.

This hub is a very useful device and a good value for its current price. I have been using it for over 9 months and have connected following devices to  my laptop: 2 external hard drives, 1 external sound card, 1 keyboard, 1 wireless mouse, 1 connector for Windows Media remote. Sometimes I connect my PCTV card also.
The connectivity is good but sometimes, too many devices give an error message. It happens mostly with the PCTV and one of the two hard drives. Though there are seven USB 2.0 ports, but if you connect all them to different devices, there is usually a bandwidth issue.
I have not used an external power supply, so do not know how that impacts the performance. However, I doubt if that will affect the connectivity or bandwidth.
There is a blue light on the hub and it can be annoying in the night, if you compuetr is in your bedroom. Either you have to turn the computer off  or mount the hub under/behind your table using the bracket they have provided. 
Overall, it is recommended to use.

I bought a yellow 4th generation nano a few months ago, and I'm VERY happy with it.  The shipping was decent, didn't take too long.  The yellow color looks gold from some angles, but I like it.  The accelerometer doesn't seem to do what it is supposed to.  They advertised that shaking your ipod will make it shuffle to a different song, but I've only been able to do that once, and I've tried a lot. That feature isn't really that useful though, so I don't mind. The design is great, the features are great. I recommend this product.

I was impressed that the unit could handle the semi-frozen meat fed continuously without hangup or overheating, and it only required ONE grinding to obtain terrific results.

"Australia" is visually well worth watching! The acting is very good. The story is okay. Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman have a lot of sex appeal and did the best they could with the screenplay which I felt was a bit hokey. Native Australians are given a lot of attention and respect.

I'm not one to write reviews - but felt that I needed to throw in my support for this item.
In December I took a chance and registered for two of these - and it was one of the best decisions I could have made. My husband and I have been using the swaddle wraps from the first day we brought our daughter home from the hospital and cannot say enough good things about them. It makes swaddling incredibly easy - and the velcro tabs are secure enough that our "wiggle worm" (as called by the Labor &amp; Delivery nurses at the hospital) can't wriggle her way out. Our ONLY regret is that we didn't bring them to the hospital with us to use when we were there! We're now looking for a couple more - but in larger sizes and in cotton for the summer months.

I bought this player as my first multi-media player.  I bought a Zune 30GB for my wife.  I was looking for something smaller and more compact for myself, I settled on the Zen 8GB.  This is a nice player, like many reviews say, it has a beautiful screen - bright and colorful.  Sound quality is very good - I'm not an audiophile, but I've compared it to other players and this one is right up there with the best I've heard.  The software is okay, not my favorite - I think the Zune software has the Zen software beat.  But, for basic functions it works well and is fairly easy to use.
Why not 5 stars?  Two things that bug me:  one, there is no 'stop' button.  If I want to stop playing a song, I can either pause, shut the unit off, or change to a different function.  Why no stop button?  I'm confused about that.  Second, shuffle play appears to only be available as a 'global' option - meaning that you set it in the main menu and it applies to everything you play in the music menu.  I don't get this - there are some things, like audio books, that I have on here that I don't want to shuffle - why isn't this available on a per album or per artist basis?  Again, this doesn't make sense to me.
Battery life appears to be good.  It would be nice if they included a cover of some kind with the player, as well as an AC adapter - but, then again, no one else seems to do that either - I guess no one wants to take the extra step to offer some bonus stuff to their potential buyers - maybe they should try reading 'The Nordstrom Way' and get some thoughts there.
Overall, a good player for the money.  I'm happy with the purchase and would recommend this unit to anyone.

Alright, so I will admit it up front---I have a love/hate relationship with epilators. 
At the tender age of 12 or so, when I firmly told my mother I want to be hair free and demanded a razor, she instead gave me an epilator and told me that with coarse hair such as mine, shaving would be futile. After lots of tears I decided that NO, I will be just like everyone else in school and razor. 
After shaving through my highschool and college years, I have come to the practical conclusion that yes, momma was right and with hair like mine---COARSE, THICK,UGLY--razoring is futile. My hair grows out by midday and it's just plain nasty. So I have returned to the epilator. 
After using this product for a few months, I LOVE LOVE LOVE the fact that I can go a week without the need to epilate, but alas--the ingrowns. They're there, there ugly, and there are a lot of 'em. But I've decided the ingrowns I can handle, the shaving everysinglefreakingday, I cannot. 
This unit keeps me hair free for about a week or so. The light whihc I thought at first was gimmicky, I've grown to love; also, the trimming head is something I use quite often. The pain isn't as bad as I remember it being from when I was twelve, and the ingrowns I am HOPING to get rid of by using Tend Skin. 
If this were cordless, I would give 5 stars.

We have two Anatolian Shepherds (double coat!) and one Aussie Shepherd (wooly coat!) as well as one large furry cat -- and all of them shed like crazy.  We use the 4-Inch model on all four pets, and all of them love to be "FURminated."  This product delivers -- the amount of hair that comes out with each brushstroke is simply amazing.  We use a vacuum while brushing to help manage the mess (even the cat allows this).  The FURminator is not a de-tangler, so when the long-coated guys are tangled or matted, that needs to be handled first, but for beautifully thinning a coat without clipping, this is the best thing I've seen.

This review is from: The Little Mermaid (Limited Issue) (DVD)
      
Mermaid was one of Disney's last great movies.....before they started trying to spin each classic tale into a 2nd, 3rd movie....each meaningless money making machines. 
The Little Mermaid is the Disney version of the Hans Christian Anderson tale. Disney brings it to life with the beautiful Ariel, and a whole cast of loveable characters- Flounder, Eric, Sebastian, Flounder, Skuttle. 
Ariel, the youngest of many daughters is bored with life under water and want to explore life on land as a human. She see's a man aboard a boat and falls in love. His name is Eric. When a storm rages, Ariel saves Eric and leaves his ashore. He sees her and can't forget her face. Against her fathers wishes Ariel dreams of life on land. She bargains with the sea witch Ursula to turn her into a human. The price she pays is her voice. She has to make Eric fall in love with her- but she has no voice. 
Ursula uses Ariels voice to bring her father to her knees. In the end, she is overcome, and Triton- Ariels father is saved, and let's Ariel go- to become a human. 
The music is some of the most creative animated music EVER. From Kiss the girl to Under the Sea, each songs is singable, and unforgettable. Boy and girls alike will love this movie about dreams, courage, and adventure.

This review is from: Slumdog Millionaire [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)
      
Jamal Malik is only one correct answer away from winning 20 million rupees on India's version of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" He's a waif and tea-server from India's slums, so the show's producers think that he's cheated. As they nearly beat Jamal to death, the movie repeatedly flashes back to his early childhood and the random events seared in his memory that enabled him to answer the show's arcane questions. But Slumdog is not about how he could answer the game show questions but why he became a contestant in the first place. He's clearly not interested in the money itself. This remarkable film is many things -- action thriller, human drama, social commentary on contemporary India, a story of human destiny, and, most of all, a tender romance. Slumdog is far and away one of the best films of the year.

I've been a Logitech gaming-mouse user/lover for a long time. In fact, the last four mice I've used with my gaming rig have been the MX510 (Blue), MX518, G5 (1st version) and now the G9.
The G9 is the perfect combination of the old G5 (precision, accuracy and on-the-fly resolution adjustments) and the MX revolution (with that killer mouse wheel), stuffed into in a customizable, comfortable and easy to control form factor.
Pros:
-I really like the new weight style much better than the G5. The weight "tray" is hidden under the grip so there is no way it can just pop out like on the previous generation mouse. For me, a properly weighted mouse is key in FPS. Too light and you are all over the screen. Too heavy and you are too late. 
-Not only can you change the weights, but you can also change the grips to suit your playing style and the color of the LED indicators. I prefer the Wide Load grip for my big hands and the blue LEDs to match my Microsoft Reclusa Gaming Keyboard (Black). 
-As long as you are a "righty", it's very comfortable, even after some marathoning. Like all previous Logitech mice I've owned, ergonomics and comfort are never lost in the design. 
-Another great addition is the ability to save up to 5 profiles to the mouse's internal memory. No drivers or software needed to load up your custom mouse settings. There is a switch on the bottom that lets you toggle through your profiles. Perfect for LAN parties when you might not be gaming on your own rig. 
-Scrolling with the Micro Gear is a blast when not gaming. There is a switch under the mouse that lets you toggle between what I call the "click" mode (a must for weapon changing in FPS) and the "scroll" mode (a must for scrolling web pages and long documents).
-The gaming-feet surface is much improved. I use this mouse with a SteelSeries SteelPad QcK+ mouse pad and it is smooth as butter. I eventually plan on moving to a solid surface pad as I've heard they can improve accuracy with less friction.
-There are two thumb buttons on the left side. I know this was added to newer model G5 (my older version didn't have this) and it's a warm welcome. These are a must for forward/back functionality when you browse the web.
Cons:
-The Setpoint software is a little flaky. I chalk this up to being an early release. It took a couple reinstalls to finally get it to work correctly. Its possible previous software versions on my PC caused this issue. Everything works now. 
-I can't use my wrist pad with this mouse. I know it sounds weird, but the back of the mouse isn't as long as the G5 and it slopes downward in a way that forces your wrist to touch your mouse pad. Because of this, it works best without an elevated wrist pad behind it. If you do try to elevate your wrist/forearm, it can be pretty uncomfortable. No biggie, I'll make due.
- $100 price. Ouch, but I've gotta have the latest and greatest.
So there you have it. I'll update this review as I put it through more testing. 
Be sure to check out the customer photos section. I took some photos of the G9 side-by-side with my old G5. Enjoy!

Although this book is not huge it is packed full of knowledge for women. The book is very insightful. Thanks for keeping it real. Some of the messages really sting but we need the truth in order for us to be empowered. Knowledge is power and having an understanding is the first step stone to my success in a relationships.

I love this little camera.  Fits in the hand, easy to use, and captures nice looking video.  What I like best of all, though, is how easily it connects to my MacBook Pro for uploading video and editing on iMovie '08.  I simply plug it in to the USB port with the cable provided and swith from REC mode to PLAY mode.  The camera asks if I want to "Playback on PC".  I click OK and open iMovie '08.  iMovie recognizes the camera and asks if I would like to upload my clips.  Done!
In the past, I never got much into video editing with my tape based camera and a PC.  Uploading / editing clips was too time consuming.  Now with my new setup, it's a pleasure and I've made tons of little movies of our family outings and school plays.  This camera and iMovie turned computer-based video editing from frustrating to fun.  Thank you!

I'm a neophyte when it comes to wireless networking. Had there been some documentation (manual, brochure, booklet or something) with this router besides just the CD setup wizard, I may have given it 5 stars. I already knew how to hook it up to my cable modem and computer but configuring it was not easy for me. The wizard proceeded to lead me through a simple configuration which I followed but when I finished, I had "excellent signal strength" but couldn't sign on to the internet. I called tech support and a technician with a foreign dialect talked me through a manual configuration in about 30 minutes. I know more now than I did, but I'm still not sure what all we did...but I'll learn. I searched the Linksys web site and found an 84 page User Guide which I printed. I had trouble downloading the latest firmware but after disabling my firewall, it downloaded in less than a minute. The router is working perfectly and I can access the internet on my laptop from anywhere in our 1900 sq. ft. condo. Tech support was very good. My chief complaint is that there was no printed documentation with which to educate myself. It seems to be a good router though.

We've had two of this model pedometer, and several other types before. 
Plus features: Excellent step counting capability, the unit seems to be able to stay within 1% of the actual steps taken, and this is maybe 5 times better than others I have used. The distance calculation for all of them should be the same, and accurate, depending on the stride length used. 
The finish on this product is EXCELLENT, suggesting the overall quality of the product. No problems so far.
The design capability is somewhat unique. The pedometer starts reading automatically every day, and keeps values until reset, making it excellent for step counting folks. 
It also indicated distance, overall steps, cardio steps, calories consumed, clock time, and steps taken for days of the last week. Other values except steps taken are not retained. I think I have these right. 
No indication of walking speed however.
Overall, excellent quality and value!

I have to question whether some truly understand what they are reading.  The qualms that people are having over certain aspects of BD can be explained in the first three books.  Take some time and read (REALLY read), and maybe BD will make more sense to those that hated the book.  
I personally loved the series and found it quite enjoyable.  It could be due to the fact that I realize that it is a work of fiction and anything the author wants to happen can.

I bought this wheel without seeing it in person, and wasn't 100% sure what it would be like. It turns out to have a very solid look and feel and seems more or less like driving a real car.

Nice product, looking-forward to 8GB from SanDisk.  I like the retractable connector, but it is tight-fitting for older USB ports; don't know why.  The included software seems like a good idea, and can be deleted.  The company needs to do a better job explaining how, because it seems there are some possible problems you could cause yourself.  I bought one each of these for the research team, and it makes backup much easier to know they have most of their user files locally stored.  I'm traveling between multiple offices and using multiple platforms, and now I just keep everything on the stick and do a tar cvf archive.tar whenever I'm on the main office machine.  Nice look, nice feel, very nice!

I received this camcorder as a gift for Christmas and have been totally blown away by it's ease of use, image quality and battery life.  The majority of functions were totally intuitive and I was able to find them with minimum fuss and without referring to the manual.  The camera has a good fit in my hand and I love the toggle navigation style, but someone with bigger hands might have issues.  Most useful aspect so far is my ability to take high-quality pics through a microscopic eyepiece.  You can take microscopic pics with a broad array of cameras, digital and otherwise, but the quality of these images is really amazing and useful to me as a student.

I searched for nearly two weeks for a new coffee make after my old style cuisinart grind and brew broke down (you know the one that looks like a deranged mushroom on top).  Anyway, I bought a mister coffee with the thermal carafe?  Big mistake, returned that POS and bought a 10 dollar toastmaster to tide me over until I could find something better.  Then I wanted the Braun flavorselect, but they stopped making it.  I saw this little puppy in my local BJ's so I came on here and looked at the reviews.  The only bad thing I could find in the reviews was "you cant see how much water is in it..".  come on folks, if that's a deciding factor for buying a coffee maker, we have to seriously reevaluate our lives.  Anyway, it's not true, you can see how much is in there, but who cares, I always measure my water on the pot?  (so you find you put too much in, what are you going to do, tip the whole machine into the sink?!) Anyway great features (what with the 1-4 cup thing, programmability, clockey goodness, adjustable burner plate temp).  And Ive yet to have a bad cup o joe come out of it.  This bad boy gets 6 stars.

This review is from: Transformers (Two-Disc Special Edition) (DVD)
      
7-4-2007.  Transformers made it to the big screen as perhaps the best movie of the year (not taking anything from Spiderman 3).  I myself saw it twice and enjoyed it each time.  I came to the conclusion a week later that I would buy the DVD when it was released.  Sure enough, I came to Amazon for all my entertainment needs and pre-ordered the special edition DVD.  From the menu to the bonus materials, it's an awesome experience.  From the booming surround sound to the crisp picture, Transformers has me hooked.  Go buy it.

This product worked very well for my cairn terrier; she hated the spray and it triggered appropriately.  Lately (I've been using it for a month or so) the spray doesn't trigger every time she barks.

Season 3 of the new Battlestar Galactica is, if anything, even darker than the rest of the series.  And this in a series that reduces the entire known human population (except for us pesky Earthlings) to less than 60,000 in the first episode of the show!
Well acted, especially at the ends of the season, BSG continues to shine in Season 3.  The middle gets a little heavy, too much emotional baggage for some.  But, it can't be All Starship Combat, All the Time!  The characters, even those who are Cylons, are flawed, human, and very relatable.
Well worth the time to sit through it all ... and the bonus features are, as always, very interesting.

This is a great HD camcorder for its size and price. The camcorder is great on daylight but just good on night/dark places. A consideration when buying this camcorder is a powerful pc because the pc requirements for editing and viewing AVCHD format is high. Also, there are only limited softwares available for AVCHD editing and the others are quite expensive. But if you're not into editing, you can view it into your regular tv via cables provided or to your HDTV but you need to buy a separate mini HDMI to HDMI cable.
Overall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase, with the price and not to mention the free 2nd day delivery and 4GB SDHC memory card by Amazon. I love it!

I am writing this after having seen the film, but before the DVD has come out. I know how much cinephiles loathe this film, but, dudes, loosen up! Sure, it is more than a little "sappy", but take some time out to be "sappy and happy" viewing this movie! The adventures of these chihuahuas, other dogs, and assorted animals is a delight, especially for those who have a "tender spot" for the hounds! This movie never was meant to appeal to the viewer's sophistication. On the other hand, it is not any sort of "chihuahua exploitation film", either. 
My favourite hounds in this California-Mexico romp are Pap�, Chlo�'s ardent male admirer and very determinedly valient chihuahua, and Delgado, the down-on-his-luck, butch German shepherd who comes to the rescue and various acts of kindness for Chlo�, even when he misinterprets the reasons for Chlo�'s second disappearance. Then, too, who cannot love the thronging hoarde of chihauhuas among the ruins of an ancient indigenous culture? Seeing Chlo� try to find the mighty voice of her "inner chihuahua" (as opposed to pampered pet squeaks and whimpering) with the aid of the leader of this pack of chihuahuas is very amusing; I wish that this bit of animal humour had been more extended! 
This is a pack of fun, and not just for children! Have a barking good time watching this film, in the theatre or at home!

I love this slow cooker! You can brown your roasts and get a bunch of yummy fond, toss in the remaining ingredients, stick the pot in the base and you've got a real roast when you come home. I had to upgrade to this larger size due to family eating more (you get that when kids grow!) and I wouldn't even consider switching to any other style of slow cooker. I even use it as a bean pot to make baked beans in the oven and for fondue parties. This thing is so wonderfully versatile: make a stew richer by finishing it off in the oven, no new pan needed. My husband brings it to work for potlucks and I've never have a problem cleaning it. There's only one thing: I don't just stick it in the fridge to hold leftovers...because I always need it in a couple days. This is the one. Get it!

This is a great, compact, easy to use external drive for your backup needs.  Small, quiet, looks like a flask sitting on the table and, in my case, is 250GB of backup space for my Mac.
The drive comes pre-formatted for Mac use (PC users will have to re-format and instructions are included for that) and right out of the box it shows up on the Mac desktop ready to use via either Firewire or USB connections.
For optimal ease of backups for Mac users, I highly recommend using this product in association with your backups.

SuperDuper is a great interface for your backup needs and can be used as a free download for initial use so you can try it out for yourself.

This review is from: Getting Things Done: The Art Of Stress-Free Productivity (Audio CD)
      
We all have too much to do, but most of us could be completing much more if we learned to stop worrying so much about not getting things done. David Allen makes the point that we have all these tasks ("unfinished loops") in our mind that keep us from attacking and completing our work with clarity. We need to identify all of our tasks (yes, every single one), and make sure they are cared for in some way (discarded, scheduled for later, immediately addressed, etc.) by our "system" so we are not burdened by them and can concentrate on the task at hand.
Adhering to the "system" that David recommends requires discipline. Those not used to planning will shudder at some of the suggestions, but there is no doubt that if implemented and executed properly, productivity improvement will result. 
I personally favor Covey's First Things First time management approach which I believe achieves the same freeing effect, while ensuring focus is placed on the most important tasks. However, both methods have many similarities and following either would be beneficial.

I really enjoyed Twilight and New Moon.  Eclipse moved along kind of slowly, but I still enjoyed it.  I thought it was quite well-written.  I liked the suspense of the main danger (the vampires).  
The love-triangle thing never really worked for me, but even worse, I never truly figured out the incredible unfounded hostility between the wolves and the Cullens.  It's not like the wolves were raised hating the vampires - it was something completely new to them, so the deep-seated hatred didn't really work for me.  
I was especially disppointed by the ending - I wanted more.  However, now that I know that she is writing at least another book, I'm okay with the ending.  (I didn't know that when I finished the book).  
All in all, I enjoyed the book, and I am excited for Book 4.

Firstly, this is not a hi end camcorder....and people shouldn't expect it to be.  
What this is is a good, low-priced, easy to use point and shoot recorder that doesn't require much in the way of technical skills.  I've used this for several months now and I'm quite content with it.  The zoom really doesn't work great because of the resolution but thats ok with me.  The quality of the standard recording setting does a decent job of capturing the "on-the-fly" things.  While this would probably not be the camera I'd take on vacation with me, its a great device to drop into a handbag or backpack for more impromptu things.
I've had no problems with connectivity to my pc.  Pop out the arm and it connects fine.  The software is pretty basic...nothing fancy at all.  But it works! It was a good purchase for me.

This is a replacement for a red Chi that lasted about two years with my 17 year old daughter. My 20 year old got a pink Chi at the same time. They both bit the dust at almost exactly two years from date of receit. I have the old ugly black salon style, this one, that is on its third year. For the first year, we were all three using it, yet it's still going. I don't know if the "pretty ones" have different specs or construction, but I'm opting for a standard, salon style replacement to see if it makes a difference. 
I am caucasian. My hair is naturally wavy changing to naturally fuzzy and frizzy with any humidity. I use good products, applied after washing and rinsing out conditioner while hair is still wet such as Biosilk's Silk Therapy and Aquage's Beyond Shine, both applied liberally. I blow dry,which makes it very fuzzy and frizzy, then spray on more Beyond Shine liberally, working it through the hair, yet avoiding too much on roots, which makes my hair shine like crazy. I then use the Chi. It gives us straight, silky, shiny hair when used properly. Do quick runs down separated hair strands about 2 or 3 times. Don't linger too long or damage can occur. Use it minimally to straighten, it is extremely hot. I can not emphasize that enough. Be careful not to let it touch your ear or other skin. It will burn you quickly and can scar.
NEVER use the Chi on damp or wet hair! It will steam cook your hair. I had a salon stylist in a hurry do that to me on my damp hair,and I'm still trying to grow out the damage 6 months later (much of it has just broken off.) My hair was fried and didn't even look like caucasian hair. It has taken many expensive conditioning heat cap treatments to even look normal again. Use it wisely and carefully and you will love it.

Yes the price was a little expensive at first glance, but in the end it was worth it. A must for racing games! I searched many racing seats before I decided to buy this one and I'm happy with Evo seat. I use the Logitech G25 wheel and the whole setup is awesome. The contruction of the seat is durable enough for my standards and I fit nicely in it (i'm 5'10" 175lbs). It's contructed with a strong metal and is sturdy. The chair also fits most adults and middle-aged children(get the slider kit for the seat because it makes easier to get in and out of; sold separately.). Since I have the G25 wheel I needed the sold-separatley shiftermount also. Putting it together was relatively easy, but did require actually looking at the instructions! My only issues is that the slider kit should be standard (not sold-separately) and included in the package deal. Also, it would nice if the design could include a mount for flight games. It's a great looking cockpit for either a racer or pilot! This a great seat!

In a extremely popular genre, few stand above the rest and "Let the Right One In" is absoluetly one of them. Tomas Alfredson's carefully controlled, yet sympathetic take on John Ajvide Lindqvist's Swedish bestseller is a masterpiece. A refreshing bloodsucker story that's rich with originality and feeling, a terrific love story and vampire tome that not only rewards the genre's fans but rekindles interest in its virtually exhausted foundation. At the same time, its characters are ironically more relatable than audiences have seen in quite a long time, thanks to a script that humanizes their problems. The fact that the protagonist is a 12-year-old boy obviously changes the dynamic of the story, but it's really the tender romance between him and Eli that gives the film its emotional resonance. 
Oskar, a transparent Swedish youth who is bullied at school. One day, a girl named Eli moves in next door. Soon, Oskar and Eli develop a tenuous romance, even as she is forced to decide whether she will stay with him or retreat from view where she can continue feeding without attracting attention from the authorities. Through his friendship with Eli, Oskar doesn't just learn how to defend himself, but to become a sort of predator himself, begging the question as to whether Eli really exists or whether she represents a manifestation of his pent-up anger and resentment.
Naturally, the international success of Lindqvist's fifth feature, like Norway's chilling Insomnia before it, has inspired an American remake, which is sure to boast superior special effects, but can't possibly capture the delicate balance he strikes here between the tender and the terrible. And such performances from two special innocent young actors.

There are so many different kinds of coffee and tea to choose from that everybody will be happy..no mess,easy,fun. I would recommend buying the cup that you can fill with your own coffee just in case you run out of the k-cups(been there) it is worth the money

A lot of people are complaining about the lack of firewire, but there are firewire-to-ethernet adapters coming out, so this is a moot point. The screen is beautiful, but attracts fingerprints, the case is sturdy, and the battery life solid. Definitely pay the extra few hundred bucks for the backlit keyboard.. over the lifetime of the computer, the cost is relatively low. Also, the Apple remote with FrontRow is always nice.

Don't be fooled by some of these other reviews. People just need to realize that your computer from 2004 just does not cut it anymore. I have a circa 2007 HP slimline computer and everything was 100% compatible. I took the HDSC card out of the camera...plugged it directly into the computer and it played instantly on my Windows Media Player. The zoom is great. Battery life is as expected. The size is perfect for travel. I recommend this item to anyone. As always, Amazon had great pricing and if you are not a Prime member yet...have your head examined!!! I paid $3 and it was here the next day!

I bought the Samsung NC-10 for my wife and the Eee PC 1000HA for myself so I'll compare:
Summary: you can't go wrong with either one.
PROS: I like the fact that the Asus keyboard is tilted towards you, makes typing more comfortable.  Also the power cord on the Asus has an elbow plug, which makes it more space-efficient and comfortable.  I like that the screen hinge on the Asus is stiffer, the Samsung  feels like it's going to fly open or slam shut.  Touchpad is less sensitive than the Samsung (good thing), Samsung gets a lot of accidental dragging of items.
CONS: The Samsung has better style and a better battery.  Also the keyboard is bigger and feels like it's better quality.  Also the international warranty and more international name recognition is important for me.  Obviously it wins for bluetooth also although you definitely pay for it.  Less smudgy than the Asus.
Remember that the Asus mouse buttons are designed to be clicked in front, not on top.
Bottom line, they're both great.  We'll see how the next generation turns out.

This is my first HD camcorder. I spent months researching and debating the merits of minDV versus AVC-HD. I decided to go with tape due to the ease of editing, easy storage, low price of the tapes, and compatibility with iMovie '09. I have not been disappointed. After a few weeks of experimenting it is easy to master all of the controls. Many have commented on the flimsy feeling of the housing for the cassette. While it's true that the outer shell of the tape deck moves a little it will hardly be noticed after a few days of use. The outer shell really just serves a protective function and is not directly attached to the tape unit itself. Also, when you have your hand around it through the strap you can grap the main part of the camera with your fingertips  essentially holding the tape deck tight. It's not a problem at all (although I don't know why they couldn't just make it feel a little sturdier). 
A couple of points. I bought the DM-50 mic. I'm a wannabe "prosumer" and maybe that's why I can't tell the difference but I don't think the mic has really enhanced my videos much, not for $150 anyway. 
A lot of people have complained about the clicking of the function and menu buttons. This can be a problem. The function button makes a loud click when your press it in the center to open the menu. It is possible to be gentle with the side to side and up/down clicks. This is one case where the DM-50 accessory mic has helped. I find that if I'm careful, I can change settings while recording (mic level, exposure) without the mic picking up the noise. The buzz of the tape itself is essentially completely eliminated. Overall, very very quiet. I mention this because this was a key concern I had. I have a Sony DVD camcorder and the noise from the DVD spinning and recording is unbearable. I didn't want to spend money on an HD recorder and experience the same thing. 
It's hard to hit the menu button with my thumb while holding the camcorder. That's not too much of a problem because you can't use the menu function while recording anyway. The view finder does not adjust as mentioned in other reviews. I never use the view finder anyway so it's not a problem for me.  The life of the included battery is not long so buy another one. Also, unlike a Canon rebel camera, it does not come with an external charger for the battery. Those can be quite expensive, even on Amazon. If you are a beginner like me an want to transfer video immediately you have to buy a firewire cable. I didn't have one and was so eager to upload video I had to go to best buy and drop over $30 on a 6 pin firewire cable. Save yourself some frustration and money and buy one off Amazon for half the price at the same time you buy your camera. The widest angle setting is not that wide. I'm going to buy the canon wide-angle lens soon. I think this is probably the case for any camcorder. 
So, for someone who just entered the HDV market I am extremely pleased with this purchase. It is easy  to use with my mac and iMovie. I think it feels sturdy. It is pretty daggon quiet. And the picture is just unbelievable. The media is perfect for me. I got what I wanted.

I got this for $200 after rebates and I would pay the full retail price after using it. This mixer can turn an occasional baker into someone that wants to open a cafe. It's fantastic. I recommend using it with 1qt and 2qt flexible silicone bowls. The flexible bowls help in getting the stuff into the bowl without a big mess. I find that to be more help then the flour chute that it comes with.

I've purhcased several different brands of pedometers, but Omron is the most accurate by far.  I also purchased a couple dozen of them for some of the employees I work with to help encourage them to be more active.  Everyone loves them and many have asked where I bought them so they could purchase one for their spouse or friend.

I wrote this to help out others who bought it.  As soon as you run the install disk, the program crashes (cannot get onto internet) so the install disk appears worthless.  Don't give up, look for an icon that says the manual.  It is almost hidden.  Open the document and print it on a color (highly recommended) printer.  Guess what, they didn't provide a manual on paper and the electronic manual is behind an obscure button.Basically, you can talk to the box using internet explorer without an internet connection.  But you need to know the address.  So you have to go into DOS, and ping it.  It will return an address.Then you go into your internet explorer and type that address (something like 168.169.200.55) and you are in the menu of the box.  Then you tell the box what type of internet connection you have (POPeP, POPxx, xxxx, xxx etc (I forgot)), supply your password and user name if you provider requires it,  Then it should work as a wired router.  So how do you know if Verizon is using POPep or another internet connection?  You have to call support.Wireless is easy if you don't use passwords.   Of course, that is dangerous.  I suggest you first get the connection to work reliably without passwords before worrying about it.I recommend passwords.  More pitfalls.  If you use password, it provides you with 2 levels of encryption.  Use the simplier smaller one because your wireless PC card cannot handle the complex one.  Then it ask you for a key phrase, supply something - this is not your password.  Then 4 keys are generated on four lines.  Write down the key for the first line -- this is your password even though it is not named as such.  I haven't tried the other lines, maybe they are passwords also.On your wireless card, when you log on, it ask you for a password, supply what I said in the last paragraph.If you get fustrated, shut everything down and power up in the sequence suggest in the manual.  Some of the software/hardware changes requires a reboot -- even though the software didn't ask you to.Is this complicated enough?  I have 2 doctor degrees, make my living as something like a technical writer, built my own computer from chips, can program in C, Fortran, Pascal, machine language, and I still couldn't figure it out.  I don't have network experience.  You may need to call support and have someone guide you through - like I did.  Make sure you buy from a place with a liberal refund policy.

This is an ultra-portable laptop with Linux and wireless Internet access.
* Can mount Windows SMB shares.
* Plays DivX, MP3 and YouTube videos. The Firefox already had a MPlayer plugin.
* You can install and run RealPlayer for Linux on it if you want. There are web sites that show you how to add Windows audio and video codecs so you can play WMV or other Windows format audio/video files.
* Mine already had Java 5.0.
* The location of the Right shift key needs some getting used to. Keys are quite small and I can't keep typing on it for an excessively long time. 
* Was able to login to using my Skype account and make VoIP calls right out of the box. There are green and pink jacks for the headphones and mic.
* Dictionary was set to Chinese language by default but you can set it display English.
* The E-book reader is able to display Plucker format e-books from Project Gutenberg.
* It displays PDFs using Adobe Acrobat Reader and the displayed text is quite readable especially in Full Screen mode.
* Setting up wireless internet connection was very easy. 
* You can plug in a USB stick and it gets automounted. A "Flash disk" window automatically comes up with the contents of the drive.
* The E-Book icon gets lost after you do a Software Update but there are web sites that show you how to put it back.
* Ctrl-Alt-T launches an xterm. Running konqueror gives you a bunch of useful utilities.
* GNU Emacs and MIT scheme both are not installed but they can be installed if you need them and they do run well on it. Read about adding Xandros repositories and pinning repositories first before attempting to install software using apt-get.
Check out the unofficial EeeUser wiki site for photos and a lot of useful info.
* It is possible to NFS mount shared filesystems. Just add nfs entries to /etc/fstab and they'll be mounted when the wifi interface comes up. You'll probably want to unmount them manually though before shutting down the eeepc: sudo umount -t nfs -a.

If you are in the market for an external sata drive, this is the one to get. I have been buying external HDDs for 5 years now and know a good one when I see it.
Pros:
- Lay down design. (Very sturdy. I don't think I'll be knocking it over any time soon.)
- Supports esata, firewire, and USB.
- Surprisingly quiet. (Awesome. All of my other drives are pretty noisy.)
- Does not come with any sluggish and useless programs that you are forced to use.
- Very nice looking. (Most people don't even know its a hard drive until I tell them. It looks like a shiny black box. Very minimalistic, and very Apple (if that's your thing.)
- Includes all necessary cables (except USB, which you will not be using if you bought the version with esata. The USB only version probably comes with a USB cable.)
Cons:
- In comparison to other external HDD manufacturers LaCie does not provide as good backkup software. (For most this is a non-issue.)
Overall I am very impressed. I researched heavily for the perfect external drive and chose this one; I have no regrets. After 2 months it is still running smoothly and quietly, looks nice, and blends in very well with my dark wooded desk.

This is an outstanding, ingenious litter box !After trying the "automatic self-cleaning" (good for nothing) and returned litter boxes...I once again decided to try a new litter box. This one is great ! I ordered the largest size for my 2 cats. You simply roll the litter box (and it's not heavy) , then return it to the orginal position and the "clumps" are deposited in a nice tray , you simply pull out the tray and dipsose of the waste. There are no parts to wear out, no filters needed, no waste bags needed. It would get a 5 star rating if it had an auto-clean up on the litter the cats leave on the carpet after using the box. I don't know why I don't see these sold in stores.

Customer review from the Amazon Vine&amp;#8482; Program (What's this?)
      
I have both a PC and a Mac, so I rarely worry about virus protection. The PC is a necessity. The Mac is a godsend. So I bought OneCare for my PC not really thinking about what I'd need it to do. Someone else had recommended that I try AVGFree, which worked just as well. Well OneCare lived up to my expectations, which were low. You can put this program on up to 3 PCs for virus, adware/spyware, and firewall protection. The software is easy to use, with a color coded bar that tells you your computer's overall health (green = good, red = better go buy a new computer). I have Windows XP and had no connectivity issues. This program seemed to detect things well enough, with no annoying pop-ups, and I haven't really had any problems. I'm not much of a PC guru, but I'd recommend this product to a friend. It comes with 24-hour customer phone support, which in my opinion is worth the price in itself.

I originally saw this item in a pet store, watched a video that was part of the display and watched with skeptisism at how much fur they were combing off the dogs.  I thought the price too was a bit too high.  Then  our groomer said she broke down and bought one and was amazed at how well the brush worked on our dogs.  I have a Husky and a Alaskan Malamute, one with long hair the other medium long hair.  After purchasing this from Amazon I gave it a try, wow, was I impressed.  Our husky has shorter hair but he has a lot of down undercoat which can get very thick and hard to brush out.  Within a short time I pulled out quite a bit of this unwanted down fur and he had no complaints and actually  enjoyed the brushing.  The brush also worked well on our long hair Malamute who has less down fur but still I was able to get quite a bit of loose hair off of him.  I must say I am very impressed with this product, it is a bit pricey but in our house the higher price is worth it.

My son wanted a video camera to film him and his friends skateboarding.  I saw this at another online store and bought it.  The High Definition quality promised by the name made it seem worth the $205 price.  Plus the small size seemed a plus.  
Should have read the reviews here first.  As others have said, if you want to film people in motion, buy something else.  If you hold this camera in your hand, the picture jiggles as your hand moves.  But the capture speed is slow enough that any motion is jerky even if you put the camera on a tripod.  Filming a skateboarder doing a kick flip just did not work well with this camera.  
It's not false advertising.  This is a fun camera, well designed.  If you freeze the frame, you see a pretty good picture, with good definition.  And the camera is very convenient for using with a laptop.  It charges from the laptop's USB port (that is actually a little inconvenient for us -- a normal charger would be easier).  Uploading pictures to the laptop is simple.  No problem there.  
We need something different (and I'm sure more expensive and less convenient) for the skateboarding.  But we may keep this camera for fun.  It packs a lot into a small, easy-to-use package.  We won't really use it, I'm afraid, but it feels a little harsh to think about sending this clever gadget back.  Like sending a puppy back to the pound.  
[Update -- I did return it.]

Is it worth paying for half a season of the best current science fiction television series? Only you, the customer, can answer this question. However, I suspect that many loyal fans of Ronald D. Moore's brilliant update of "Battlestar Galactica" will purchase this DVD set. Since I have not yet seen the episodes, I can't comment on them directly, but the second season contains a couple of fascinating plot twists and turns. First and foremost, does the Colonial fleet survive a potential civil war between the Galactica crew led by Commander William Adama (Edward James Olmos) and supporters of President Roslin (Mary McDonnell)? How does Adama recover from Lieutenant Boomer's (Grace Park) attempted assassination, and is Colonel Saul Tigh (Michael Hogan) truly fit to serve as the Galactica's acting Commander? Is the Boomer trapped on Caprica with  Lieutenant Karla "Starbuck" Thrace (Katee Sackhoff) truly pregnant? And what contest of wills shall develop between Commander Adama and Admiral Cain (Michelle Forbes) of the battlestar Pegasus? I have no doubt that Ronald D. Moore, his fellow writers and directors, and the cast of "Battlestar Galactica" have wrought yet another compelling half season of riveting science fiction drama which is light years ahead of anything I have seen since "Babylon 5".

Overall, I am satisfied with this coffee maker.  For starters, the coffee it makes is delicious.  I have been using a French press for the last 5 years, and was weary about buying an auto-drip brewer, but I was not disappointed.  The first batch of coffee turned out rich and hot.  It is also aesthetically pleasing to look at.  I like the simplistic toggle controls and dials.  However, it is not very ergonomic.  The water bin is right up next to the filter.  It's hard to pour water into the bin without spilling it into the filter.  I have learned to pour it without splashing it, but there should be some sort of separator or conduit that assists in the pouring operation.  Also, the measurement indicators are inside the bin, and are impossible to read, so it's a good idea to measure the water before you pour it in.Instead of a glass carafe and a heating element, I wish it had a stainless steel carafe.  That way, I could just have it turn off right when I am done brewing and then keep the coffee warm for hours.   On this machine, if you want warm coffee, you have to keep the heating element on.

My mom gave me this ice cream maker as a Christmas present a few years ago. My husband and I are vegan, so we were really excited about creating new vegan ice cream recipes. (I eventually started compiling them in my blog, A Vegan Ice Cream Paradise.) 
We've never had a problem with the machine. Every recipe I've invented has frozen nicely. I keep the bowl in the freezer all of the time, so I can make ice cream whenever I feel like it.
I do wish that the plastic covering/shield thing was dishwasher-safe, because it can be a pain to clean, especially when I'm using a high-fat coconut milk. Still, it's not too difficult, and the reward (awesome vegan ice cream) is worth it.

simply the best film ever from start to finish it captures the imagination and despite its length you never want it too end. All the cast put in sterling peformances.

A timeless classic and i like the fact that the film has a multi racial cast and resulted in Hattie getting a much deserved oscar. Vivien Leigh and Olivia De Havilland are among my most favourite actresses ( Bette Davis, Joan Crawford &amp; Lana Turner included)

For literally years I'd been waiting for the price on a "real" flash based camcorder to drop to an affordable level.  At one end you had traditional tape camcorders, which gave great results but it seemed every one I had would start malfunctioning in a few months, not to mention the trouble of copying off the tapes.  At the other end were the cheap "camcorders" who's best claim to fame was taking a moving picture.
Finally I found the FS100; some people may sniff that it's "only" standard resolution and does not have optical stabilization, but I can live with that.  Mine is currently running with a 16GB SDHC card, that gives 3 1/2 hours of video.  For people who want even more, I say remember the 30 minute VHS-C tapes?  
It's quiet, takes good quality videos, and pretty much gets the job done.  For the price it can't be beat, it even takes external microphones.  My complaints about it are minor, but I'll list them so people can see the FS100 in perspective:
The joystick menu is a little awkward to get used to.
The light is a bright blue/white LED.
In dim situations video quality goes downhill fast--but then remember the price. 
The battery is removable but entirely internal, so forget about the "extended power" batteries available for most other camcorders.
The last is probably the worst, it records in .MOD files without flagging the 16:9 wide screen format.  The .MOD files will play in media player (they're Mpegs in a different container after all) but all scrunched up.  If you use a free utility called SDcopy they are not only turned into Mpegs but with the correct wide screen ratio.
You won't want to use the FS100 for making the next Hollywood movie.....although after watching the quality of recent flicks you probably could.  But this is a great little camera for family movies, vacation trips, and general shooting.

Bella is back to her normal clumsy, book-reading self in this third book in the Twilight series. She and Edward are planning for their future while the Cullens and the werewolves are preparing for an attack for several vampires. Jacob states his case to Bella, and all hell breaks out. Meyer certainly has a way of writing a Gothic style novel with teenage angst and romance and making it fresh and utterly enjoyable. I had a hard time putting this book down (we left the doctor's office with only 35 pages left to go, and I actually was upset that the appointment was over too early!) Edward is beautiful, cold, the moon. Jacob is earthy, warm, the sun. How is Bella supposed to choose between the two? (And how come this girl gets all the cute guys? If I were a teenage girl from Forks, I would be seriously peeved with her!) Less than a month until the release of Breaking Dawn, and I'm almost as anxious about it as my daughter. We'll have to fight for who gets to read it first!

This is pedometer is Consumer Reports #1 rated digital pedometer- and I can see why. It's extremely light weight and really easy to use with just four big buttons on the front. Here's a few of its best features:
-it can accurately senses steps in your belt, pocket, OR purse!
-it has a large display for the visually impaired
-it has a 7 day history so you can see progress (or lack of)
-it calculates calories and distance in addition to steps
I'd recommend this little device to anyone who wants to lose weight- just begin one day, and the next day, see if you can maintain or beat your previous step record. Now how easy is that? 
So what DIDN'T I like about it? Not much. Perhaps the ONLY sort of negative thing I can say is that you will need a tiny screwdriver to open the back of it to put in the battery. Other than that, if you're looking to increase your activity a little to improve your health, look no further. Also recommend The Sixty-Second Motivator for anyone who needs more motivation to stick with an exercise program.

The replacement litter cartridges for my Scoop Free Self-Cleaning Litter Box are easy to use and I have had no trouble with them leaking/spilling, etc. They are MUCH easier and less messy to deal with than changing the recepticle on my old LitterMaid! My husband, who won't have ANYTHING to do with the litter boxes generally, was even impressed at how easy these are to change. Unfortunately the litter cartridges are fairly expensive, and I have yet to find them in a local store so I have to plan ahead and order them from Amazon (free shipping is good, though). They also don't seem to last as long as advertised - I change mine about every 10-14 days (the box is used by only one of my two cats).
A minor thing that bugs me about the cartridges is that they are too big to fit into my garbage can after they've been used, so I have to put them in a trash bag and set them next to the can on the curb on garbage day. Not a huge deal, just a minor annoyance.

This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)
      
To begin, a little description of setting, just to give context.  I'm an eighteen year old college fresh(wo)man who was looking for a few good reads for winter break.  That being said, understand that although I'm a year or two older than the target audience of the Twilight series, I'm other wise who the author is writing to.  
Like "Twilight," "New Moon" is about the now eighteen year old Isabelle "Bella" Swan and her vampire love, Edward Cullen.  However, when he mysterious leaves her - claiming to no longer be in love with her - she finds herself lost and flailing.  Fortunately, she finds support through Jacob "Jake" Black, a Native American werewolf a year or two younger than her.  Together, Bella overcomes her loss and deals with a new threat around  her.  
One of the things that bothered me about "Twilight" was how Bella seemed to have no hobbies or past time interests.  Which is why the relationship she develops with Jacob in "New Moon" was really satisfying.  In contrast to Bella's relationship with Edward, her friendship with Jacob seems to have serious substance.  They have shared interests, fears and friends.  In contrast, Bella's "friends" from school are vapid and meaningless figures.
On a related note, "New Moon" is certainly more involving than "Twilight" - there's more drama than "Oh-no-I-love-a-vampire."  It's more like "Oh-no-my-vampire-love-has- abandoned-me-and-now-I-might-love-a-werewolf-but-vampires-are-trying-to-kill-me-crud."  You can see the added dynamic.  
Another sort of petty thing that bothered me was Stephenie Meyer's use of adjectives in reference to Edward.  He was always described as "perfect" or "beautiful" - physical traits.  Never was he described using emotional adjectives, like "gentle" or "loving."  To me, these physical adjectives trivialized the quality (and intensity) of Edward and Bella' relationship.  I mean, (since it's from Bella's perspective) it seems clear that she only "loves" Edward for his physical features.
I know about of fans like this series because they can place themselves in as Bella and pretend that the story is happening to them.  I'm not sure how any one can do this, or really want to do this.  Bella is a hugely dependant and unstable character.  She's weak emotionally and occasionally whiny.  But still, some how, I'm drawn to her personality.  Maybe it's just because I wonder what stupid thing she'll do next...
Which, I suppose, blends into another problem I had with "New Moon" - and the entire series in general (though I have not yet read Eclipse).  Bella's personality is severely lacking.  She lives for and through Edward - so when he leaves her, she is nothing.  Eventually, he returns, but does she learn her lesson?  No.  She continues to be as dependant as possible.  As a feminist, I'm a little ashamed of myself for liking these books.  Bella represents the typical "damsel in distress" who relies only on the male figures in her life for support and survival.  
"New Moon" is like a guilty pleasure.  It's full of fluffy drama and angsty-ness.  Admittedly, this appealed to me better three years ago, but it is fun none the less.  Will Bella and Edward end up together?  Will Edward save the day?  Will the Cullens return?  We all know the answer, but it's still fun to find out.
Oh, and enjoy the not-so-subtle "Romeo and Juliet" parallels before they get old and tiresome.  Which they do.  Quick.

I had a $10 Vidal Sassoon Clipper which was plain painful to use, used to tangle my hair, wasn't sharp enough, used to make a mess and would take forever to cut hair. This Wahl is everything that Vidal Sassoon wasn't. I bought this after much research and almost to point of resigning myself to getting my hair cut by a stylist.
In short, the cutting surface is sharp and powerful, like the ones used in salons (I used to wonder how is it that the stylists clippers cut so effortlessly compared to mine) and in my case just 1 pass of this clipper was enough to cut it to the level I want. What used to take 1 hour to cut now takes only about 10 minutes, and I was able to do it on my own! It has many attachments and extras which may or may not useful but the clipper itself is a gem -- powerful and painless.

We didn't start watching BSG until recently, because we didn't want to get involved in another series. But this is completely worth it! Often, in a sci-fi series you can pigeon-hole characters as "the smart scientist", "the well-meaning but dim strong-guy", or "the token female." That is not the case here. The characters pull you in with well-developed personalities, flaws and all. Throughout the series, they continue to evolve and respond to the changing situations. Even the Cylons are more deeply human than many characters in other series, and ultimately, that's what makes this series so engaging.

Battlestar Galactica?  My goodness, what a horrible name for a TV show!  If my co-worker hadn't assured me it was worth watching I never would have given it a chance.  I had never heard of the original show (wasn't even born yet) and there are a lot of sci-fi series out there that I can't stand (Star Gate, Firefly, Voyager).  On the other hand I do love drama and shows with emotional depth and complex story lines.  Before BSG came into my life I would have said my favorite show of all time was HBO's Six Feet Under.  BSG has all the drama, depth, character development, and intelligent writing that Six Feet Under had but on top of all that you get some amazing special effect and battles in space!  I've also always been partial to stories concerning the end of the world and the self destructive nature of mankind (I was particularly fond of Stephen King's The Stand).  Battlestar Galactica takes all my favorite genres and premises and swirls them together to make one amazing show that is part sci-fi, part political thriller, and part spiritual fantasy.  If you're just looking for another Star Trek: The Next Generation you may be in the wrong place.  If, however, you loved Star Trek: Deep Space Nine then BSG will take you to a whole new level.
You can't go wrong with Season One.  Every single episode is worthy of multiple viewings.  The weakest episode is either "Water" or "Tigh Me Up, Tigh Me Down" but in all honesty they still carry their weight.
If you like BSG then I would also highly recommend the soundtrack.  The music of the show is beautiful and integral.  At first it may just seem like a bunch of percussion but as you make your way towards the finale of this season you should really start to notice some of the excellent musical themes.
Also, be careful when purchasing.  I made the same mistake so many others made.  This set INCLUDES the MINISERIES.  Luckily I realized my error and was able to cancel my miniseries order before it shipped.  Season 4.0 also includes Razor so don't go buying that separately either.

I love this coffee maker! It is so fast and easy to use. There is also a huge variety of k-cups to choose from. I have noticed you get more k-cups and cheaper prices if you buy them from Amazon. Yeah this coffee maker is more expensive then a drip coffee maker but you will save in the long run by not throwing out coffee, plus you will always have a hot fresh cup of coffee! I wish this model had a water filter built in but I use the Pur faucet water filter and that works great, alot cheaper then using bottled water and you get the same results. Go ahead and get one, you will be happy.

Yes, like many others when I first bought this version of Quicken I had just crossed over from windows to mac.  I had some difficulty adjusting to the different interface, and a few quirks when transferring my account data over, but now that I've been using it exclusively for about 5 months it is just great.  If you're switching from PC to Mac, just think of this as a different product and don't expect the exact same features.  I find this one actually easier now that I've used it. I was just used to where everything was in the windows world since I had been using that for so long.
Here are the things that I think can be improved on the Mac version:
+ there's no way to sort the account register by amount. You can only sort by date and the check number field.  I like to sort by amount sometimes so I can find a specific dollar amount (minor irritation)
+ the reporting feature is a bit cumbersome.  If you're like me, you'll want to just click the buttons and get your report created without having to read the documentation.  I managed to get what I needed without the help screens, but it was still a bit of work.  Thinking back, I had this same problem with the Windows version, so this is not a Mac vs Windows issue - it's an overall Quicken issue.
+ I was really annoyed with the way it connected to my online banking accounts when I first started using this version.  I think it can still be improved like the Windows version.  With the Windows version, one click from inside Quicken and it's connecting to my bank and downloading the latest transactions for all my accounts.  With the Mac version I have to login to my bank then download each account's activity file.  Now that I'm used to it, it is less irritating to me, but it still would be nice to have that one click feature back.  
What I do like about the Mac version:
It works.  It does what I want it to do and it does it well.  I don't need to keep a Windows computer around just to do my banking.  When I switched to Mac, I switched to Mac - it's all or nothing for me.  
I don't do a lot of finance work with Quicken, never did.  I just keep track of my checking, savings and credit cards.  I know there are a lot more features should I ever need them.  But I like simple, quick and easy.  Quicken 2007 for the Mac works for me.

My Maltese has been taking this product for almost three months.  She had dark brown stains covering her entire face from eyes down.  She is 13 lbs, and I have been giving her a scant teaspoon every day.  After a few days of treatment I noticed that her eyes were very watery, but with clear tears.  Excess watering stopped after another couple of days and she has had no more staining since that time.  New hair is growing in white and she looks like her beautiful self again.  Powder is a little messy, but she eats it readily when mixed with a little wet food. I highly recommend this product.

I got this ice cream maker for Christmas, and since I've been making at least one batch a day, for me and my husband. We both simply love it! I read some of the slightly negative reviews from people saying that the ice cream maker doesn't freeze all the ice cream, or that the edges of the freezing bowl are frozen while the middle is liquid....well, I think this is normal, as long as the machine moves, you won't get a totally hard frozen ice cream from it. Once the 20-30 min cycle is done, I take the mixture out of the bowl and move it to a freezer for another 30 min or so, and eat it then. By that time the consistency is perfect, and the ice cream won't get hard, and still tastes great...smooth and yummy :) the only negative (but this goes for all home made ice creams) that the longer you store it in a feezer the more ice crystals (the harded) it will get, so the best is to eat the whole batch the same day...which btw isn't a problem at all...home-made ice cream is simply delicious!

I was almost put off by the price of this unit, but I took the plunge and bought it and I'm glad I did. It makes perfect coffe every time, and has the flexibility to produce exactly the cup of coffee you want at any given time. Those who say the coffee is too weak don't understand how to use the machine [see my recommendations below] and those who say it's too noisy haven't placed it properly. The pump does make a bit of sound but if you isolate the unit from hard surfaces, with underpadding for example, the noise is tamed considerably.
About the strength of the coffee: It helps to understand that the K-cups themselves are portioned for a standard 6-oz coffee cup. Most people do not actually use 6-oz cups and have never made a standard measure cup of coffee. I hadn't either until I got this machine. Now I understand. If you use a 12-oz cup, you need 2 K-cups and two shots of water at 6 ounces each. Not cheap, but sure is good. You can adjust strength for taste by adjusting the amount of water. 
One of my sisters likes it a little weaker than standard, so she uses a single 10-oz shot of water. Comes out perfect for her. My son likes it strong, so he uses bold K-cups, one with a 6-oz shot and one with an 8-oz shot of water to make his morning coffee. I like mine kind of medium, so I use two regular K-cups (not bold), one full-caf with 6 oz and one decaf with 6 oz and I'm all set. Great coffee. You can make it any way you want from standard coffee cup to travel mug. Don't try to make a full travel mug with one K-cup unless you like it weak. One friend of mine likes it that way, though, so there really is a recipe for everyone.
Let's face it, K-cups are not cheap coffee for home brew, though it is more than competitive with barista-served boutique coffee and every bit as good. But for those who can't get past the price of the K-cups, there's is a very clever little contraption, easy to use, that lets you use whatever coffee in whatever portion you like! What could be more flexible? Even with the little contraption, making coffee with this machine is much easier and tidier than using any kind of coffee pot, and the results are fantastic.
I agree with the spring water recommendation unless you are lucky to live in a place where the water is additive free with no taste of its own. I buy store brand spring water by the case. It's worth it for the quality of the final product. If you care about good coffee, go the extra distance. If you use the little brew contraption that lets you use your own coffee, then the little extra cost for spring water, which you should be using anyway, isn't really a burden. If you pony up for this appliance, you probably don't care all that much about the price of coffee per cup. Besides, if you buy coffee out, this is less expensive even with two K-cups per serving and spring water. All that doesn't come to $1.39, so there's really nothing to complain about.
This is not to say the machine is perfect in every way. Probably no machine is perfect in every way. It could be quieter. The reservoir could be larger. The control panel could have more buttons and adjustments, although I don't see how that really would be an improvement. You can adjust the water temp and the shot size, so what else do you really need? Get it, brew up some fine coffee and enjoy. It's quick and easy and very neat and clean. If you love coffee, you won't be sorry you got this machine. Enough said.

IYCC uses this router at its factory in Laredo, Texas, and has installed it for clients. We usually install a version of DD-WRT ([...]), and are enthusiatically happy about the results. We have one in our warehouse, where the daytime temperature is often well over 104 fahrenheit (40 celcius) degrees, and we run it overclocked. Despite the punishment, the router runs without failure day in and day out. 
It has been known for several years now that the Linksys WRT54G series of routers, running the Linux operating system, performs better than commercial-grade routers, with lower energy consumption and better features. Most, if not all, models of Linksys WRT54 routers can run Linux without any problems, but this particular model (the WRT54GL) is allegedly engineered with components that run best with Linux. 
The hardware inside is no different in kind from the hardware on other models, and is even a bit lighter on RAM and flash memory than some. Our only conclusion is that Linux is so much more efficient that it just doesn't need more hardware to do the same work. Less hardware means less heat stress, so one would expect more stability and reliability. Perhaps that's why it runs so well in our warehouse. 
You may be asking why you should pay an extra ten to twenty dollars when the other models of the WRT54 will run Linux too. I can only answer for myself: I'd rather spend twenty more bucks and be assured it will "just work". Our engineering time is worth more than $20 if there's a problem, so I just pay the freight. I also have to admit that I feel better about paying for a product that is engineered for the most advanced operating system on the planet than working with a half-baked, crippled, proprietary OS.

I bought this as a Christmas present to myself last year. It's easy to use, makes great ice cream, and the design is simple, so there aren't many complicated mechanical things going on that are in danger of screwing up. It was a great price, and now I can make whatever weird flavored ice cream I can think of. If you want to control the fat/carb/preservative/etc. content, you can do that (but why would you WANT to?!?).
Be prepared to make space in your freezer for the bowl and for your collection of home made ice cream. Within a day or two of buying this, I had about 5 or 6 different flavors in the freezer.
Pros- easy to use, easy to clean, simple design, great price
Cons- freezer bowl can hog limited freezer space

This review is from: The Wizard of Oz (Three-Disc Collector's Edition) (DVD)
      
Warner Bros. released The Wizard Of Oz - Three Disc Collector's Edition on October 25th, 2005. For many Oz fans, this was a long time coming. The long awaited Special Edition to one of cinema's most cherished films. The DVD presents the film in it's original aspect ratio of 1.33:1 fullscreen. Keep in mind that this movie was filmed in 1939 so no widescreen version exists. In 1955 MGM re-released the film to theaters but in a cropped 1.85:1 widescreen. Basically all that was done for this release is placing black bars on the top and bottom to make it fill the theaters movie screen. So in reality, a authentic widescreen version doesn't exist. The audio &amp; video for this release is stunning as Warner took the time to clean up the picture and make the sound crisp. As for special features, Warner has included over 10 hours of impressive features. If you're a fan of Oz then I would say this is a definite buy for you.

The scroll wheel concept is difficult if you're not used to it. Some menus you use the buttons, some you use the wheel. Some features are hidden, like when a song plays and you hit the center button: who knew? It's certainly not in the worthless 37 page PDF manual, nor is how exactly to pop in the micro SD cards; they have to be flush, not hanging out or they're not really loaded. Found that out by luck; almost called Support. 
A non-typical USB cord? Who are they? iRiver? Everyone else can get by with the standard USB cable, from mp3 players to GPS devices; not Sansa!
The lack of documentation is irritating. First thing you have to do is charge the player and meanwhile download the updater and the manual. Great!
Otherwise, I like the heavy feel, the screen is bright, the controls work OK once you're familiar with them, and the micro SD expansion slot is a great feature. You could buy the 8GB model, get a 16GB SD card and have more storage than an older PC! as well as 99% of the other mp3 players on the market.
I can't comment on the video capability since I haven't used it, and the FM tuner is nice.
Seems like the volume is a bit weak; have to go up to about 50% of max before it gets very loud. 
And of course, the earbuds suck. I got a nicer pair than these for free when I bought some Schick dispo razors. Come on, guys! Is a decent $5 pair of earphones too much? Guess so.
Good, expandable player for the money. Some dealers have a problem keeping them in stock, like hh Gregg! Paid $59 on sale (when they finally got one in.)

It kept locking up my PC at the worst possible times, and nothing I tried, even with the help of Netgear's tech support, was able to eliminate the problem.  An attempted Trendnet replacement (Trendnet TEW423PI 54Mbps 802.11g Wireless PCI) was worse; I couldn't even get any driver to load.  In contrast, this MSI Turbo mode wireless PCI card has worked like a charm and with its little separate antenna gets a much better signal from my wireless router.  This is an inexpensive wireless PCI card that is compatible with my XP PC system and that instantly resolved my PC's locking-up problem.

After nearly 20 years of great service our old Panasonic Breadmaker "died".  We think the new one is even better than the old one and look forward to more years of fresh bread, rolls, pizza dough, etc.  Only find the receipes a little difficult to follow since the measurement for the flour is suggested to be in weight.  Otherwise it is a "winner"!

Very popular and good all-around: value, nutritive value (for what it is: focus on protein), taste.
Caveats are that the older, cheaper prices seem harder to find now, and that the cholesterol content is potentially high (at 10% of the day's allowance per serving, it can add up).

I have had this unit for three weeks and LOVE it!  I have used the Omron HJ-112 (the basic Omron pedometer) for over a year and asked for this one for my birthday.  The pedometer is pretty much the same great pedometer as the HJ-112.  The color is different, but the function and basic size are the same.  It is the software that makes this a "must have" - even if you are happy with your current pedometer.  The software was easy to download - just pop the disk in your drive and follow the instructions.  Enter your goals (daily steps, aerobic steps, distances, etc.) and then start walking and get ready to download your info.  To download info from your unit, attach the cord provided from your unit to your computer and a prompt appears on your screen.  It downloads the information (up to a week of stats) and insert them into a chart.  I like that the information is shown as numbers, bar graphs, and colors.  It gives easy feedback regarding your progress.  NOTE:  When I received the unit, it was miscounting steps and the customer service rep on the phone was AWFUL!  She didn't know the product and offered unhelpful advice.  I emailed the company, they sent me a new battery, and it has been great ever since!  It doesn't change my rating, but I expected the service to be as good a the product

I love it. I like to buy imported Greek yogurt, and use that as the starter. The yogurt I make is creamy and wonderful. Very thick, and mild. I love to put frozen mixed berries in a tupperware, and add some of this yogurt and a sprinkling of splenda. By lunchtime the berries are thawed and the yogurt is still cold, to me it's like cheesecake! I also use this yogurt in the place of sour cream, and I make a great Tzatziki by adding a little olive oil and some grated cucumber. I have used it a lot and just love it.

I purchased this brand after reading many reviews of others. I have stored my important documents on this along with my music and photos. I am happy with the ease of using this drive.  I do keep it turned off while I am not using it.  One thing I did realize is its best to turn it off when shutting down your computer due to the fact when you shut your computer down at the end of the day and begin it the next time your computer will not boot up with this device on. I think it is well worth the money you pay for this storage drive when for only a 8 GB flash will cost you nearly as much.  I feel confident now should I ever have to do a restore on my computer all my important documents, photos and music will not be lost.

We've tried at least three different gates in different doorways and entrances, and this one's by far the best. It really is hands-free to open. Better yet, it closes automatically by bumping it shut, unlike some gates that require a hand to *close* them, argh.
One complaint I've heard is about the foot pedal breaking off. That hasn't happened for us, and we use two of these, nor has it happened for friends (and friends of friends) who've had one of these for several years. I suspect that anyone's who broke had the gate in the entrance either too tightly or crooked. So, use the tool that comes in the box for checking the tightness, and use a level(ing device) to get it straight.

This review is from: Gone with the Wind (Four-Disc Collector's Edition) 1939 (DVD)
      
This movie is a historical film on many levels. It excellently portrays the old south, a civilization "gone with the wind." It seemlessly adapts the rather long Margaret Mitchell best seller onto the screen. It won a historic eight Oscars including the first to a black actor (Hattie McDaniel). And aside from all of these things, it is a highly entertaining film.
For those who are unfamiliar with the story, I just recommend seeing the film. It has a little bit of everything, though it is certainly heavy on the sentiment. It is, after all, an homage to the glory of the old south. Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) is a rather flirtatious girl who finds herself insanely jealous when she finds out that Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard) is to marry his cousin Melanie Hamilton (Olivia de Havilland). Suddenly, the south enters a war with the north and the world becomes chaotic. A scoundrel from Charleston named Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) is a constant companion to Scarlett though she treats him badly. It is obvious that he loves her, but she is too enraptured with Ashley. Battling poverty and responsibility when she aches for the life of luxury she led before the war, Scarlett strives for happiness when everyone else has lost their strength.
There are many gorgeous scenes in the movie; each scene stands out as a work of art. Who could forget the simplicity of the women strolling down the grand staircase at the Wilkes' barbeque? Or what about Eric Linden's heartwrenching screams as he fights to keep his leg? What a powerful statement the field of wounded and dying soldiers makes as the torn Confederate flag weakly waves in the breeze! And who is not jarred by the impact of the red sky against the hopelessness of the war torn fields of Georgia? Scene after scene cements itself into the unconscious and becomes more powerful with each viewing.
There are many interesting behind-the-scenes stories to be told about the film, many of which are included in the 1989 documentary included on disk three. Most interesting about this piece is perhaps the audition footage with some of the top names in Hollywood. Also on this disk are features about the restoration of the film and footage of the premieres. 
Disk four is essential for fans of the stars of the golden age of Hollywood. We see a recently recorded bit with de Havilland where she relays memories of the making of Gone With the Wind. It is always interesting to hear firsthand information. The Gable documentary is not wonderful, but it does include memories from a longtime friend. Leigh's tribute is a bit better, and includes many clips arranged artistically for an emotional impact.

I received the mixer in mid-December and have tried to put it through its paces in the last three weeks.  I have done whole wheat bread, bagels, pugliese, cinnamon rolls and a variety of cakes and cookies (yep, I'll be reviewing a treadmill next :-)).
The mixer has done everything I have asked of it.  I have done doughs that have up to 8 cups of flour without any problem (including the wheat recipe with freshly milled wheat flour).  The dough hook is simply fabulous and kneads the dough just right.
The one time that I worried was when I doubled the cinnamon roll recipe so that it called for 12 cups of white flour.  The company rates this machine for up to 14 cups of flour, so I went for it.  I got all of the flour into the bowl and got about halfway through the kneading and the mixer overheated and shut off.  I waited a couple minutes and turned it back on and finished kneading.  I have decided to just limit what I do to about 8-10 cups of flour.  If you want a mixer that will do more than that, I would probably go a different direction.  For me, to do a couple batches of bread each week for my family, this machine was the best value. 
One other thing is that for doing a small amount of whipped cream or something, this mixer is overkill.  I guess I need to get the 3-qt. bowl and then it would be fine.
Overall, I am thrilled with the product.

I purchased three of these Corsair flash drives for my employer based on their competitive price and the pictures of them on Amazon. They looked like good drives online and we were not disappointed when we received them. These flash drives are well made with a rubber surface and come with a nice and thick neck lanyard. The cap stays on them very well, and in my opinion they are of much better construction than similarly priced drives from Kingston and SanDisk. You don't have to worry about the drive falling off of the inch thick lanyard and metal clasp - everything is very sturdy, and nothing about the drive feels flimsy. I wear mine around my neck every day without problems and have done so for the past six months. My boss keeps hers on a keychain and likes it as well. I don't know how their file input / output performance compares to other drives as I don't transfer large files very often, but this is a USB 2.0 drive so it can't be much different from any other drive on the market. The drive is a little think, but it includes a USB extension cable just in case you need it. In summary, if you want a flash drive, this one gives you a very good value for your money. I am planning on buying another one for my personal use.

This was a gamble that paid off. It is the first flash-based camera I have ever had. Some reviews said that it was difficult to use with a Mac. In fact, this camera is easier to use than my previous Canon HV20, takes a great picture,  and is easily edited with both iMovie 08 (blah) or Final Cut Express. I can bring it into iMovie 08 or FCE, save, and edit it in iMovie HD , as sometimes I find FCE too complicated.
The only real con I have with it is the fact I cannot re-upload to the flash card, and since I sold my HV20, I have no miniDV camera to upload to. I sometimes do shows to put on local community tv, and it needs to be on miniDV. The sound from wind is a little worse than with the HV20, but I usually tape indoors.
The pros include small size, no tapes to lug around, 12X zoom, superior sound from forward facing mikes, the ability to use sd cards from my photo camera, and an easy button. Often I find the easy button gets better shots than when I do the work of setting focus etc. I absolutely love the integration with Apple's FCE, as I can pull up log and transfer, and choose what clips I want to transfer over to my computer. And watching something on  a high-def tv from the hdmi connection on the camera is a joy.

As for the Cuisinart GR-4 Griddler, the first one I received was defective (more on that at the end of this review). The replacement product I received works fine.  The Griddler is very stylish-looking with brushed stainless steel and "retro" styled knobs.  The top of the unit gets very hot during cooking and should not be touched without a protective mitt.  It takes several minutes to heat up, no matter what temperature you select, which I found a bit surprising.  It also takes a very long time for the unit to cool down once you are finished cooking.  It helps to leave the unit in the open position for faster cooling, but you can plan on waiting at least 30-60 minutes for it to cool down to where you can safely clean it.  A light on the grill/griddle selector knob turns red when the unit is switched on, and a separate light on the temperature knob turns green to indicate when the desired temperature is reached.  The product works as advertised.  It can be used as a panini press or opened flat for a two-section open-faced griddle.  There are two sets of metal plates that come with the Griddler - a flat set and a set with ridges.  They are coated with non-stick material and therefore only plastic or nylon utensils should be used with the Griddler to avoid scratching the plates.  The plates are easily interchanged and washed.  They are also dishwasher-safe.  You don't want to break or lose them - they cost $30 each to replace on Cuisinart's web site.  There are two cheap plastic collection cups that can be placed at the corner of the griddle to collect grease.  They are quite small, and do not hold much.  A cheap plastic cleaning tool is also provided to help clean the grill plates.  I have not needed to use it.  Overall, I am happy with the Griddler.  I paid $109.95 for it, which I believe is a good value.  It would be over-priced at the $199 suggested retail price.  Cuisinart's quality control and customer service with this product was surprisingly poor.  Before having to return the defective unit I tried to get a replacement manual from Cuisinart.  They promised to send one in 7-10 days which never arrived.  That's the only reason I docked the Griddler a star.
Speaking of poor customer service, my first Griddler arrived from Amazon.com in an open shipping carton with the flaps loosely closed rather than taped shut.  The manufacturer's box for the Griddler, however, appeared to be unopened.  Nonetheless, the product arrived with no instruction manual or registration material, and one of the switches on the front of the product was loose and sparked when the unit was plugged in.  I returned the product for a replacement.  Amazon's customer service is terrible.  There is no telephone number to explain the problem to a customer service rep (I challenge you to find any phone number of this nature on their entire web site).  Instead you must request a refund or replacement by email.  They direct you to download a form to cut &amp; paste onto your package to return the product by USPS (with no tracking) at no cost.  Alternatively, you can elect to send it by other means, although there is no mention of how they will reimburse you for the shipping cost (although they claim they will do so).  Since there is no telephone number to call for clarification, I would be very skeptical about it.  I sent my package back by USPS, but I have no way to prove it.  A company the size of Amazon.com should have far better customer service than this.  They should at least have a phone number you can call about problems with your order.  It is clear they would rather not have to deal with their customers about problems.  Having ordered thousands of dollars worth of merchandise from Amazon over the years, it has really made me think about ordering anything of major value from them in the future.
Addendum (3/21/06) - since I wrote this initial review Amazon has added a link to contact a customer service representative by telephone.  To access it, click on "Help" in their main menu and click on the "Ordering" link.  To the right is a link to request a telephone contact.  I used this link for another order issue, and it worked very well.  The representative called me back immediately.  Clearly, Amazon has made an effort to improve their customer service.

My specs:
2.4GHZ Penryn
2GB Ram (About to upgrade to 4GB)
256MB Nvidia GPU
Superdrive
Multi-Touch trackpad
I debated between this laptop and a black macbook for a long time. I weighed all of the options vs price and to be honest, I bought this one even though it didn't look as good to me on paper. I'm so glad I decided to buy this one over the black macbook. The larger screen gives me more than enough room to multitask (but it does not take away from the portability of the laptop). The backlit keyboard and multi-touch track pad are irreplaceable. I am constantly working on computers and find it really hard to use the track pads on our HP TX1000 laptops. The laptop is more than fast enough for what I use it for (web browsing, movies, iTunes, movie editing). I am looking at upgrading to 4GB ram in the next week just to squeeze everything I can out of this computer. Build quality is excellent and battery life is better than any pc laptop I've ever owned. Speakers sound incredible! Leopard is a good OS and I love iMovie and garageband! Photobooth is fun with the built-in camera. 
 I only have a few complaints. It gets HOT! When downloading torrents or doing any kind of video editing, this thing heats up fast (although it cools down very fast due to the aluminum casing). It could use more usb ports, but I rarely find myself needing more (only when I need to plug in my iPod, blackberry and usb memory stick). Wireless is a little finicky when traveling from work/home/public wifi, especially if each network has different ip schemes. All this took was a little profile setting and I was good to go.

I am 26 years old, apple-shaped, and 5'3 with big calfs and arms, so I got this workout in an attempt to have that dancer's body. It's about 45min straight of fast-paced dance performance cardio. No wonder pop stars are so toned and skinny. It's hard to do that for 45 min straight. The only thing is they must have really good dance instructors helping them get the moves... This video is like trying to learn every move Britney does in her high-impact dance moves just by watching. It will take quite a while, but I guess it's doable.
I'm giving this 2 stars, because she doesn't cue you at all during the dances. During the section that she teaches you each dance slowly, you never actually do it to music two times in a row to get the feel of the transition. Also, when you do difficult transitions in slow motion, it looks and feels completely different than the actual real-time dance moves.
Great workout if you can learn it. I think I'll keep trying begrudgingly bc I want a dancers body. Let me know if you know a cardio workout that would give me lean calves and arms...
Her mat workout is awesome, though.

I'm determined now to lose this fat and in my first workout in less than 10 minutes I was breathing heavy and sweating like crazy!  I just started using her DVD and I can feel the benefits already. The moves are not complicated but by not taking breaks and quickly moving from one type of workout to another, you're getting an intense workout! Knowing Jillian, I'm sure I'll lose weight with this DVD as long as I'm consistent!

I've been using the Braun 7526 shaver and cleaning stand for 5+ years, and have found it to be the best balance of close shave with minimal irritation. I work in a chemistry lab so anytime I have a device that uses a "solution" I try to think how I can mimic it and save money and time. I make my own aftershave lotion by mixing rubbing alcohol + baby oil + water, mostly alcohol (17 parts), oil (3 parts), water (1 part), more oil if you want your skin to be softer, but it will shine. Shake well before each use. For the Braun cleaning solution, be aware that the red light comes on due to the level dropping low; it has nothing to do with the amount of hair debris in the solution. Dump the remaining solution; add water through the small hole and shake well to get as much of the hair debris out of the container. I use two ingredients in the solution: rubbing alcohol and finger nail polish remover (non-drying lemon scented). The volume of the solution is a little less than 6 ounces, but I make a mark on the side using a Sharpie when the container is new, and just fill to that level each time. Just add a couple ounces alcohol through the small hole (I got a small funnel at a hobby store), add a tablespoon (15 mL) of polish remover, slosh to mix, then add alcohol to the mark being sure the container is on a level surface. You can try to mix or let the shaver mix it when it recirculates. The polish remover is good at removing the oils left on the cutter/foil, and the non-drying formula leaves a trace of oily ingredient that seems to help lube the shaver as well. Use at your own risk.

My little Asus Eee PC1000HA arrived yesterday early afternoon, and I've been on it ever since, doing work and testing its potential.  I'm delighted with it overall--it's no surprise that, as of December 31, 2008, it's sold out at Amazon.  I did a huge amount of research on netbooks before purchasing this, and the other Amazon reviewers (for all the different netbooks researched) were most helpful. Their warning that this is only an atom processor is a good one--this doesn't work as fast as my five year old Gateway 200XL (XP pro, centrino processor, 1.6mhz, 512mb RAM, 60gb hd), which I just loved until it ran out of hard drive space and could not be upgraded. On the other hand, the Eee PC1000HA really is great for internet and word processing--what it is designed to do.  I had to turn off various background-working programs, like webshots and google indexing, but these are still useful, within limits.  Don't run an anti-virus scan while working, either. When all the background programs were turned off, internet access, even internet video, was speedy on my wireless connection, with no gaps (or gasps) at all. 
Here's what I really like about this machine:
1)  It's pretty quiet--much quieter than the old Sony Vaio picturebook I used to use.  I'm a student, and the Eee PC will not draw the negative attention in a small graduate class the way the Sony picturebook did (and so I had to stop using the Sony and sell it).
2) The screen is clear and the 10.2 inch display is quite adequate.  I don't really miss a bigger screen at all.
3)  The keyboard really is do-able (except for that blasted right shift key--it is quite a stretch for my little finger, even with a smaller keyboard).  But that is adjustable, too.  (See previous reviewer regarding downloading free software that allows users to change keys.)
4) I can watch my news video clips with no lags at all. 
5) BATTERY LIFE IS GREAT!  It really is 7 hours with (a) LCD lighted display turned down all the way, (b) wireless off.  In other words, if all you have to do is word processing, you can do it.  Otherwise, 6 hrs with wireless and lowest light LCD, and 5 hrs with wireless and highest light LCD. 
6) The upgradeability is the best on any machine I've ever seen!  Not only are the RAM and hard drive easily removable and replacable, but so is the wireless adapter!  Now THAT is really COOL!  Still, I'm quite pleased with the wireless and its speediness.
What I don't like:
1) I don't like this touchpad so much.  Now, don't get me wrong--I prefer touchpads to a mouse, but I really miss the old synaptic touchpads.  I could do all kinds of great things with the synaptic touchpads of the olden days, and all with one finger!  Now I have to learn a whole new touchpad sign language, and even then, the touchpad is not as responsive as I'm used to on older laptops. The scrolling, for example, is inconsistent. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. The Elantech smart pad is not as easily programmable as the old synaptic touchpad on my Gateway 200XL.  What ever happened to Synaptic?  Why throw away what was great?  On the other hand, this touch pad still does not drive me crazy the way the touchpad does on machines like the HP Pavilion 2660SE.  So, Elantech is a step in the right direction, at least, even if it hasn't gotten as far as what the old synaptic touchpad could do with just ONE little finger (not two or three).  That said, even when you take the time to learn the new sign language, the Elantech touchpad still doesn't scroll as easily as a single quick stroke of my finger used to on the old synaptic. With the Elantech, I have to keep stroking the touchpad to scroll--too many movements!
2) I don't like the hard drive light under my right wrist--I can't tell if the hard drive is being written to or not.  I like having the hard drive light visible, and this is not positioned well to make it easily seen, unless I stop typing and remove my hand.
3) A nice size hard drive...and they partitioned it!  UGH!  Forget that they tell you it's 160gb--it's really 80gb on one partition and 61gb on the other.  So their math is off (80+61=141 gbs, not 160).  I have used an old HP nc4000 that does read all 160gb on the hard drive, so I can't figure out why the 1000HA misses 19gb on its hard drive, even with the updated bios. 
So, for the touchpad, which is less than the old synaptic quality and simplicity, I give this little machine 4 stars, not 5.  But so far, I'm delighted that I got this from Amazon before it sold out. Amazon's deal was the most affordable option for this model (with these specs for hard drive and battery life), and I looked everywhere, even at Best Buy. So all in all, this will serve my needs very well and I'm delighted with it.

My husband bought this, and I thought it was very expensive for a coffee maker, and I doubted that it could keep the coffee warm without the typical warmer under the pot. I was wrong. The convenience of being able to take the coffee straight to the table is matched by how well this thermos keeps it hot. We bring a full pot to the table and read three newspapers each morning, and the last cups are always as hot as the first.
The machine brews very quickly, is easy to program so that the pot is ready for you when you wake up, and it's as easy as any other maker I've had to clean. I like the fact that I can't break the pot, and I don't EVER have to worry about whether I left it on when I leave the house. 
So for all that, this coffee maker is worth the money, and it looks like my husband was right. Just don't tell him.  ;)

Let's start with this, I love this machine, is small, compact, beautiful and powerful.  It runs cold, it's easy to carry and it's easy to work with it.  Running Mac OS X, Windows or Linux every task is a breeze.  The 2.4ghz processor is fast and runs cold.  The 2gigs of ram is sufficient for my daily tasks, but for more powerful multitasking upgrade to 4 gigs.

I've tried a number of products with my australian shepherd who's not a huge fan of being groomed.  Tried a 'shedding blade' which was effective in removing hair but she wouldn't sit still very long.  The FURminator is equally effective and she tolerates it much better.   Also easier to use.

I purchased this computer for my 4 yr old daughter in an attempt to stop her playing around with my laptop. However, sometimes I find myself using her laptop while she is asleep. It basically does everything my full-sized laptop does and more. 
However, given the overall size of the laptop, people with large fingers may have a little difficulty typing a lot of data. Overall, it is a wonderful machine with all the necessary stuff - wifi, webcam, built in mic etc. It even comes with the drivers if you decide to load Windows XP on it (although changing the OS probably isn't necessary).

I bought this for my wife for Christmas.  She (we) have three cats.  In the past she would brush them everyday with an old hair brush.  She saw a commercial about the FURminator and wanted one.  This thing WORKS!  Christmas day she brushed all three and you would not believe the fur that came out.  And this is from cats that were brushed every day.  The kitties feel softer now and they seem to enjoy being brushed by this thing every bit as much as the hair brushes.

Have nothing but good things to say about the abilities if this storage device. My only complaint is the difference in actual storage size and stated storage size. I understand losing some space for transfer area but there is a big difference between 465 and 500GB. Would have given this produce a 5 star rating if not for that.

Miami forensics analyst and moonlighting serial killer Dexter Morgan survived in part through the first two seasons of Showtime's groundbreaking drama by mastering mimicry.  In order to avoid suspicion as the "quiet loner", Dexter pretended to be an Average Joe and forced himself to maintain a girlfriend, take an interest in the lives of his co-workers and join a bowling league.  His fans have known, however, he'd rather be home researching his next project.
That aspect of Dexter's life changes in Season Three of television`s greatest drama.  In addition to deepening feelings for Rita and circumstances that lead him to thoughts of being a husband to her and a father to her children, Dexter develops his first true friendship with Assistant District Attorney Miguel Prado (Jimmy Smits in the kind of role he was born to play).  Through their connections to a case, Dexter and Miguel slowly begin to see the darkness common in each other, leading Dexter to thoughts of adding a sidekick for his Dark Avenger alter ego.  
Fans of the sociopath on display in the early episodes of the series may find faults with the humanizing of Dexter in Season Three.  Topics can arise in discussions about the show as to whether the sociopath Dexter is slowly being cured (something that is supposed to be impossible) or whether he has never truly been a sociopath at all, just someone who thinks he is and thus behaves as such.
Season Three is a worthy addition to the Dexter library, a series that explores new aspects of his personality, while remembering to address the core concerns of his relationship with his sister, his memories of his father and his nocturnal practice of cleaning up the streets of Miami.  With the new truths of Dexter reveled in Season Three, you may start to question whether Dexter targets criminals because of the Code and because they are easy prey or whether Dexter does indeed have feelings and believes he is bringing justice and order to the world with his noble deeds.

This review is from: The Princess Bride (20th Anniversary Edition) (DVD)
      
This movie was my first introduction to the story of The Princess Bride and for years I loved watching it. This movie is seriously a hit for all ages. It keeps young children interested and gives the adults jokes to laugh at. The comedy with sarcastic undertones, the simplicity of good vs bad, the impossible feats accomplished and of course, the awesome performances from the actors were all players in what makes this movie fun to watch. There is a prince and a princess, bandits, fighting, magic, and love. All under two hours. And yet for all the times I've watched this film, I never knew about the book by William Goldstein. Folks,this is one good read. The humor is more prominent than what you pick up on from the movie and it gives you background info on characters like Fezzik and Indigo. While it is much more encompassing than the movie, the movie stays true to the book which is another reason to like it. I would recommend both movie and book to those looking for a fun plot to follow.

Honestly, this is the best baby product I've ever purchased.  I got the extension, too, so it takes up a big chunk of our living room, and it's PERFECT for our little crawler.

This thing is SO easy to use, so clean to use, I could never go back to just a "box."
We use crystals and the grate works just fine.  With the crystals instead of the litter sand, it doesnt leave any left over residue, about every 2 days or so we tip the box over and get rid of the clumps.
About every 2 weeks or so we open the top up and just dump all the litter left.
SO EASY!

I read many reviews on this item ranging from "dont buy it" to "great product" and I was worried when I finally decided to buy it. However, this product works great and I am beginning to wonder about the people who wrote the bad reviews. This product does not leak, it is not noisy (when kept properly filled with water) and it does not collect mildew and mold or the other horrible things mentioned by other consumers. The plastic is extremely easy to clean and it takes me less than five minutes to clean it. The only "problem" with the product is the pump. The problem is that the pump supposedly clogs easily and you must take it apart to clean it etc., but I did read a helpful hint about this: wrap the pump in a piece of pantyhose and no fur and crumbs will enter the pump. So I did just that and I have had no problems with any part of this machine. My cat is not afraid of it nor is she angry I took her stagnant bowl away. I do suspect that if your kitty like to drink falling water, such as from a faucet, she may enjoy the "other" product more. Keep in mind that the "other" product is noisier (falling water). This product on the other hand is extremely quiet. Best of all, this product costs almost 50% less. In my opinion, this is a better product to start the cat off with getting aquainted with fountains not because it costs less but because it more mimics the stand alone bowl. Then maybe when the cat gets adjusted to this fountain you can buy the "other" fountain that lets the water fall in a stream. There is nothing wrong with two fountains anyway, my cats had bowls all over the house. My guess is that it adds some fun in their day.

We purchased the Cuisinart coffeemaker after doing on-line research.  My only issue with it is that it is hard to see the water line when filling it.

I first saw the Furminator listed as a grooming feature in an ad by a local groomer.  The ad had a link to the web site, where I learned more about the product.  I found the best price at Amazon.com.  The product works very well at removing the undercoat from my dog!  He's a mixed breed with some Australian Shepard heritage, so he's got that furry layer under his top coat.  First, I brush him out with my regular brush to get the knots out.  Then I use the Furminator to work out the inner layers.  It's amazing how much extra fur comes out!  Apply gentle pressure with even strokes, being very careful of (or avoiding) sensitive areas.  It's very easy to use.  Reduces shedding very well.  My dog's coat looks beautiful after grooming!

This review is from: The Dark Knight (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)
      
Was skeptical to spend 2 and a half hours to watch a lame, comic-book inspired, predictable, unrealistic, paper-mache-acted, and insanely overhyped film.  I'm glad I was dead wrong.  I'm not a huge movie buff, but my favorites are almost always intelligent, stylized, off-center, masterfully directed crime-dramas.  Didn't think that The Dark Knight would fit that category: It did.  Wonderfully.  
Its absolutely impossible to take your eyes off the screen.  I'm not sure if it was the director's intention (although it seems clearly so), but I found myself not caring much about Batman.  I found the Joker and Harvey Dent much more memorable, interesting, multi-faceted, and empathetically flawed.  I didn't see the Joker as evil at all: Just a man answering his true calling, sometimes at the expense of a few lives and structures.  He and Dent show that time and hardship shape a person considerably more than quick gratification, wealth, and being lauded for doing "good," as Batman experiences.  While Batman is aloof and guarded, and  the Joker is extroverted, daring, and well-defined by his experiences, which he impresses upon Dent. Not sure how it made a PG-13 rating.  Even with no cursing or sexuality at all, this movie is clearly for an adult audience, with its twisting messages on morality, decision-making, and views on humanity.  I highly recommend this film to anyone who digs thought-provoking, beautifully-shot, roller-coaster films.

H&amp;R Block's "TaxCut Home and Business" has been a great choice for me for several years, and each year they improve the product.  I ordered the 2008 version today.
This package is remarkable.  It includes software for your Form 1040 individual or joint tax return, plus programs to prepare your Corporation or S-Corp (Form 1120), Partnership (Form 1065), or Estate or Trust (Form 1041).  State returns for all these is included.  Employment tax return preparation (W-4, 1099 and so on) is also included.
For the personal return, electronic filing for federal is included (5 returns), but you will have to either mail your state return or pay a fee (reasonable by my lights) to file electronically.  I don't think electronic filing is available for the business returns.
Anyway all this is in the package.  Don't overbuy.  If you don't have one of the businesses mentioned, just get the appropriate software for 1040 returns.  But if you need to file for a business (Corp/Partn/EstTr) plus your individual return, this deal is hard to beat.
Let me end with a few cautions:
If you are buying "TaxCut Home and Business + E-file,"  you don't need to buy "TaxCut Premium + State + E-file."  IT'S INCLUDED.  I mention this specifically because they seem to be marketed together on this site.
The forms to be used for this year's income tax haven't been completed by IRS.  They will be updating items during the first couple of months of 2009, and there's no way the software I'm buying today can include all of them.  So I'll need to go to the HRBlock update site a few times (the software connects and links up) to get updates from both Fed and state.
With all tax software there is a learning curve, so "read the lines," think about what you're doing, allow adequate prep time, and review the results before you file.  I think you'll be pleased.
PS - I used to work for H&amp;R Block but have not for several years.  I use the software because I think it's the best for the price.

Out of the box the drive was very slow (1.6 GB/30 min.!) in Windows 2000. E-mail support from Western Digital was useless.

So when my HP laptop broke down, I wanted to find a new computer that would be affordable but functional. That's when I discovered the netbook genre. With so many brands out there, Asus's Eee Pc, Acer's Aspire one, MSI's Wind, HP's Atom, the list goes on, it can get a bit confusing. But at the end of the day, all of these netbooks are similar, if not exactly the same when it comes down to the technical specifications (screen size, processor, hard drive, wireless card, software, etc).
But there are several features that set this netbook apart. First, the Samsung NC-10 came out on top with its 6 cell battery (many other netbooks only have a 3 cell), which equals a MINIMUM of 4.5 hours, and easily over 7 hours when in its power saving mode. Also, this model has a 160GB hard drive, leaps and bounds over what many other netbooks offer. And, in another great stride, if you want to increase the RAM (from 1gb to 2gb), Samsung did a brilliant job making the RAM so accessible. It's as simple as removing a screw from a panel on the bottom of the computer that says "Memory", removing the panel, and switching out the memory aka RAM. The function keys are very useful, for everything from volume, screen resolution, power mode, wireless networking, external screen options, and more, making using this computer a genuinely fun experience. I had Vista running on my old laptop, and even though I have not upgraded the RAM, this thing runs effortlessly with the XP provided. If you are worried about Windows XP, don't be, because I have transferred every single application that I had with Vista to this computer, and have lost zero performance. It even has a slot to insert SD memory cards (unfortunately not for memory sticks).
Now, nothing is perfect. First of all, I have medium sized hands, and though the keyboard works great for touch typing, there isn't much space between the start of the keyboard and the end of the computer to rest your wrists on, which can strain yours hands after a while. Purchasing a wrist pad will help. Also, one drawback of having one of the roomiest keyboards on the netbook market (95% full size) means this has a smaller touch pad. It's very reactive and has the same pinch/stretch properties that apple touchpads have, but it still takes some getting used to. Also, I got this in blue, and the top is a fingerprint magnet. And if you plan on playing music from your netbook, be sure to get external speakers, because these speakers are by far the worst thing about it, with a generic tinny sound to them. 
If I had to go back and do it again, I would definitely buy this computer again. Of course, in the world of technology, things constantly change, so in about a year I may have my eyes on a Vista or Windows 7 netbook, but for now I'm very happy with this purchase.

Wow, this really does get rid of kitty hair! And I do believe that my older cat is shedding a little bit less than she used to. I can almost make a new kitty by the time I'm done combing my older kitty. And it removes the hair that's at the 'root' as it explains in the papers that came with it. I do think you have to be careful to not get carried away though. I think I read something like it could cause skin irritation if it's used for too long at one time (if your cat lets you, that is). My cat doesn't like this brush quite as much as the last brush but she still comes when she sees me holding it (she just doesn't stay around for as long so I may have to walk after her while brushing her if I don't think she's gotten a good enough grooming). But her coat feels and looks SO much better after each brushing (it almost seems like she feels better too). And I don't have to brush as often as I did with the other brush.

In a panic I contacted Amazon and they had a new one sent overnight.Meanwhile with some internet search ,I found a fix (re boot).So did not send the problem unit back to Amazon.I decided to allow them to charge me for the new one and I gave that away as a gift to an unfortunate PODLESS person. I was impressed with the professional and responsible service from Amazon!

This is really full blown notebook.
I was expecting a good netbook, but I was surprised by the build quality and performance of this little machine.
I ended up using this machine more than the regular notebook I have, as most of the time I'm just checking my mails or doing some simple search.
There are 2 things that could be better.
One is the screen size. Even if it's a small netbook, I feel like they could have used more space for the screen, as it has some thick plastic borders around the screen.
The second one, is that adding more RAM is pretty difficult, and you can only upgrade to 1.5 GB of RAM, seriously reducing the life cycle of the computer.
But anyhow, this is a great product, and I'm satisfied by the purchase. Recommendable.

The pros:
1) Can be used in your pocket, and works at most angles -- a big improvement over most pedometers.
2) I like that it keeps a separate subset count for aerobic steps.  On the main screen it shows total steps, but if you press mode, it shows the subset count of aerobic steps you have taken (if any).  Whenever you have maintained a pace of at least 60 steps per minute (very slow walk) for 10 minutes, it counts all those steps as aerobic steps.
3) Built in clock
4) Automatically resets itself at midnight
5) Keeps a 7 day history.
The cons:
After about a year, something must have broken inside because it would sporadically stop counting any steps.  Because of this, I had to purchase a new one.

I absolutely love this fountain. I have a small mixed breed dog (25lb), a Shetland Sheepdog, and 2 large cats. I used to have 2 Vanness 3 liter automatic waterers. The water that I filled with them would sit for a week or longer and never be less than half full. After about6 months, I got tired of how hard they were to clean and that the animals did not want to drink out them. So I splurged and bought this. I really love this thing. My pets love it also. They drink it all to the point of me refilling it about twice a week. They are drinking so much water now. Which I don't mind because they need it. It only takes about 10-15 minutes to clean the entire unit and it is very easy to do. My only complaint is that I wish they made a bigger unit. I got the Jumbo, but still I wish they made a larger one. Everything else about this product is excellent.

This review is from: The Dark Knight (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)
      
   It is kind of funny when you read what people have to say about this movie.  Like anything else in pop-culture, for every ten people who love it there are ten more who think it's terrible, or boring, or too violent.
   The movie is not terrible.  It is fast-paced and entertaining.  Nolan starts with a number of threads at the beginning and brings them all together by the mid-point of the picture.
   "The Dark Knight" is faster paced than "Batman Begins" but that is to be expected because with any good comic-book or superhero adaptation...the first movie should always be about the backstory or how Batman came to be Batman.  Sometimes it is done well like in "Iron Man" or "Batman Begins" and sometimes you get "The Fantastic Four"
   These movies are almost like the James Bond movies in that the movie is only as good as its villian.  In this regard it is Heath Ledger that takes this movie the extra mile.  Many in here have said that if he didn't die soon afterwords there would have been no big deal over his performance...that could not be more untrue.  His performance has nothing to do with his death.  He delivered the most chillingly real picture of evil on the screen since Hopkins in "The Silence of the Lambs."  The performance was picture perfect, from the designer suits, to the unkept hair, to the tick of sticking out his tongue like a serpent.
   Helping balance the chaos on that side are real grounded performances from Christian Bale and Gary Olman (I defy anyone to find a movie in which he gived a subpar performance!)
   The special effects are fantastic, but they never become a crutch for Nolan because at its heart this is a character study.  Some would probably have liked 2+ hours of mayhem, but those are probably the same people who hated "3:10 to Yuma" because there were not enough shoot-outs.  These movies are about the men behind the action, not the action itself.
   I am dissappointed by the lack of features.  If a company is going to market a special edition and charge you more for it, it should be bursting with extra stuff...but in the end, you buy the movie for the movie.

We are so please with our knife sharpener, my husband sharpened every
knife in the house as soon as we got it.  It delivers a great edge on
all knives we have sharpened.  We also demonstrated our sharpener for
my parents who were also impressed so we purchased one for them and they

The large FURminator is an absolute miracle for anyone with a German Shepherd (and a German Shepherd mix who inherited the undercoat).  While I can't explain how it so gently removes the thick undercoat without pulling at the outer coat, I can say it's already saved me hours of grooming and it's done an exponentially more effetive job than I ever could with any of the other dozen or so tools I've tried.  Although I'm probably going to have to come up with some other form of upper body workout to replace the long aerobic brushings I used to force upon my dogs, there are a lot fewer furballs rolling across the tile and both dogs come running when I pick it up so it's making everyone happy.

It's not bad.
I can watch on another PC on the same network (hooked up to a TV) and it looks lightly better than SD TV, not quite HD.  
On my laptop when I'm on the road, it's choppy.  That may be the connection, because I use an old Xbox wireless adapter to connect it to my network.
When you click the remote, it's like you fast forward time for a second.  You have to get used to it.  But if you leave it alone and just watch the TV, it's pretty good.
My friend even used it to watch a UFC PPV at his house using a giant projector on his wall, and said it was very good.

Update 8/22/08 - This mixer still works beautifully.  While I don't make bread daily, I do make pizza dough almost weekly and I love this mixer.  It also whips cream better (because of the flatter bowl bottom design) than my slightly smaller, older KitchenAid.  I'm still thrilled with this product and Amazon.com.....(Previous Review) Like the reviewer, "Cats Rule", I, too, have an old workhorse KitchenAid mixer that is about twenty-five years old and has only needed one repair throughout all of those years and hundreds of cookies and cakes.  I will never let "Old Reliable" go (I had withdrawal symptoms when I had to send it to KitchenAid for the repair which took a month) but I also wanted a larger capacity mixer.  I purchased this one from Amazon.com a couple of weeks ago and so far it has been fabulous.  For the first time in my life I made pizza dough, three batches in two weeks, using the KitchenAid recipe, at the recommended speed of 2, and both the mixer and pizza dough are great.  I did find another recipe that differed only in the amount of olive oil used (1 Tablespoon vs the KitchenAid 1 tsp) which worked even better for us (slightly less crisp crust and works beautifully with the dough hook).  I found that if I use too much flour and/or too little olive oil, the mixer did vibrate a tiny bit but still kept mixing.  One really great difference between the older, five quart mixer and this new, larger one is the shape of the bowl.  The 600 Series has a slightly flatter bowl which allows better mixing without having to use a spatula at frequent intervals to incorporate the batter at the bottom of the bowl.  I read all of the reviews before purchasing this mixer, which really helps, and I am looking for any sign of the gear box breaking (we haven't taken it apart yet to see if we have a metal or plastic box). I did speak to KitchenAid before I made this investment and they said they would replace the gear box with a metal one if mine should have a problem.  I intend to keep making bread or pizza dough each week, and larger batches of cookies during this first year - not only to test the mixer, but because the mixer works so well, so far, and there are so many fantastic cookie, cake, bread and pizza recipes out there!  My husband (voluntarily) said that he would rather have our pizzas than any other he's ever tasted, and we can choose healthier alternatives by making our own - like canadian bacon or turkey, Italian sausage pizzas.  I have noticed a difference in sound when mixing pumpkin pie ingredients, but that might be normal (and I might be overly concerned about the gear box).  KitchenAid documented my concern, at my request, in case I should have a bigger problem down the road.  I might also take an idea from "Cats Rule" and purchase a few other attachments from Amazon.com.  I am thrilled with my KitchenAid mixer, the KitchenAid company, and always with Amazon.com!

This is the best pedometer I've owned.  I get some info from my treadmill, but wanted day long info.  This is so accurate!  It counts without fail.  The best part is being accountable using the computer software.  The computer program maintains records of not just the amount of activity but type (I love seeing the aerobic walking aligned with the hardwork I put in on the treadmill).  If you're serious about maintaining your health and keeping tabs daily...this is the product for you!

The Oral-B Triumph was an excellent purchase.  The toothbrush signals the user that it is time to move to the next section for cleaning.  This is definitely good because there may be a tendency to over brush. It also lets the use know when brushing is complete.  I think this is a good tool because I don't recall anyone telling me how much time is needed to brush each section of the mouth.  At least with this function in place I know how long to spend brushing my teeth. 
I have noticed that my teeth are more plaque free compared to manual brushing.

This review is from: Wall-E (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)
      
So far this summer, we've got better movies than last summer. Especially animated films. Instead of a terrible CGI end last year (not counting the 2D Persepolis), we've got a good head start in March with "Horton Hears a Who!"
But now, the folks at Pixar are amazing, incredible, and terrific, and they have done it again. And then you get the director of "Finding Nemo" finally finishing up "WALL-E." I became obsessed and excited over the movie ever since I saw a trailer for it. And that's the case with the Pixar films.
"WALL-E" is the story of the lovable robot by the name. After 700 years being all alone cleaning up the garbage that humans created ever since they became extinct, a mysterious ship comes from outer space. A lovely female robot named EVE comes to Earth. She and WALL-E soon become friends. However, EVE passes out from a plant and her system needs operation.
WALL-E goes into outerspace and meets a lot of humans and robots. Things become a lot different for him as he meets a lot of ncie, new friends and robots. However, WALL-E soon makes his own time where he says that it should be time to come back to Earth.
Be aware of the film's lack of dialogue. There is 40 minutes where you get barely any dialogue. However, more dialogue comes from the outer space era, mostly the humans, especially Jeff Garlin. Ben Burtt and Elissa Knight did a great job playing the robots.
The movie itself delivers. The story was really good and the animation was extremely brilliant. And that's the catch with Pixar's animation. Their animation looks photo realistic. I even liked how they animated Fred Williard, who plays Shelby Forthright; it looked realistically animated. As far as story is concerned, "WALL-E" follows Piar's concept between the story and the graphics.
"WALL-E" does have some sad scenes of him getting severly injured, but it leads to some happy endings. I loved the emotions between WALL-E and EVE. The whole concept (even though its different) reminds me of an old robot movie, "Short Circuit." But I think "WALL-E" is much better than "Robots;" I didn't really like "Robots." "WALL-E" was much better than "Finding Nemo" and the rest of the Pixar films. You actually care more for the characters and the story and that's what Pixar really focuses on.
"WALL-E" captures the emotions through what an animation film should be like. No other movie could have made me feel more happy than this. I laughed. I cried. I was in complete emotion through "WALL-E" and can't wait to see it again. Now, I just wonder. Will "Up" be just as good? But the bottom line is, I was with my emotions throughout "WALL-E" than I was with "Finding Nemo."

Our 16 month old yellow lab loves to play with empty 2 liter pop bottles.  I bought him this toy because I worried he would cut his mouth and gums on the sharp plastic shards of those flimsy bottles.  No worry about that with the Tug-a-Jug...this toy will most likely survive through the next millennium!
To fill with treats,  just twist off the bottom;  couldn't be easier.  It's a lot of fun watching our dog figure out how to get at the goodies inside.  
I honestly don't think the rope pull is going to last very long;  especially if you are buying this for an aggressive chewer.  However,  don't let that stop you from buying the tug-a-jug.  Even without the rope,  it's still a great and challenging toy.

It's quick, the reusable filter doesn't make your coffee taste funny, and the thermal travel mug keeps it warm longer than a regular mug if you're like me and get distracted before you remember you made some. I wait a few minutes anyway because it comes out too hot for me, but it's always preferable to have a hot drink that's too hot instead of too cold. It fixes the problem itself in a few minutes.
A standard 16-oz straight-walled mug works just as well under it as the one it comes with if you have a favorite. I like to use it with a "homemade" Cafepress 16-ouncer at home, and the travel mug on my way to work. It also works fine to heat up tea or cocoa water for other members of the house.

So far, I'm pleased with this purchase. One minor thing, I wish the item came with a carrying case. It is small enough to fit in my shirt pocket, but I'd have liked a case to store it in when not in use. So far, battery life is good, and video and audio quality is good. I'm not much of a "camera" guy, so I can't really speak to how it compares to other products, but I bought it to record my son's school basketball games and it works fine for that. The software it came with makes it pretty easy to copy the games to DVD.

Without question the best science fiction show on the air and probably the best show on TV period. This series has some of the best production value and cinematography ever seen for a space opera. The story line and acting is pretty impressive as well. 
Now before I go into what I thought of season one I would like to state that many hard core fans of the original series do not like this new re-imagining of the Battlestar Galactica concept. That's fine we are all entitled to our own opinions I would just ask everyone to remember that just because something is different from the way you want it, that doesn't make it bad. I was a casual fine of the late 70's version of this show and have found the new series far more enjoyable.
Now onto Season one. I'm not going to say too much but I will give you a couple highlights. The first couple episodes are slow without question (you will see a number of people who found the show "boring" because of this) and there is a little to much emphasis on the character Dr. Baltar. However the show quickly picks up and we start getting deeper into other characters such as Starbuck, Hilo (who in my opinion steals the show), Apollo and others. 
Make no mistake however this is a THINKING man/womans show. If you like mindless entertainment (IE: reality TV) then you will probably get "bored" or lost because you actually have to watch the show and think about what is happening (heaven forbid that things not be handed to us on a silver platter). 
The season ends with an excellent cliff hanger that has you chomping at the bit for season two, which to date is even better then season one. 
In conclusion if you are looking for an intelligent, sci-fi cinematic experience in the form of a TV show then this is it. Far superior to shows like the Star Gate series or the latest Star Trek incarnation this show takes an excellent concept and makes it great.

I have been entirely pleased with this pedometer. I bought one a couple of months ago after checking reviews and ratings online. It costs a bit more than other pedometers, but is well worth the price. I have found its step counts and mileage to be quite accurate after calibrating as directed. The instructions are also a bit conservative in telling you which positions will not work: I have found it to be accurate even in some of the situations that are not quite kosher according to them.
I had a small problem that I needed to write to Omron about, and their response exceeded my wildest dreams in terms of speed and thoroughness.
I have spoken to others who have bought other brands of pedometer and I must say that all in all, this one gives excellent value for the price, and incredible customer service.

This product delivers to what is expected. The size is a bit larger than what I expected (about 7"x 11"x 1.5"). The back up software that is included is better than most, but there's still room for improvement (ie Apple's Time Machine, where there's  little user interaction not only to back up but also to set up the back ups). All in all this is a great product; my only major complaint is that it takes several seconds to access data when the drive is turning on (waiting for the platters to rev up to speed).  But after that, the speed is great especially over firewire 800.

I've spent several weeks week getting to know the Zojirushi Fresh Brew... and for the most part, I'm quite pleased. It has some foibles [which I'll get to in a moment] but on the whole it's a very capable coffee brewer. More, it's one of the very few home models I know that can brew 8 cups of just-roasted coffee at a proper 2 tablespoons per cup ratio without fuss, and - this is important! - maintain proper brewing temperatures throughout the entire brew cycle.
The details...
Zoji has been making vacuum pots and the like for nearly 100 years, and they've been making an assortment of rice-cookers, tea brewers and hot water dispensers for decades. While this is, I believe, their first home coffee brewer, they've got more than a little experience in kitchen electrics. They've put that experience to good use.
If you've ever brewed up a thermos full of coffee using a big Melitta filter cone then this setup will look pretty familiar. For all intents and purposes, the Fresh Brew simply adds an automated hot water delivery system to the mix... with a few improvements.
Improvement number one: not only does this system brew into an all-stainless thermal carafe [no hot plate here, thankyouverymuch] but it also insulates the brew basket. What good is it, after all, to heat up all that water if it's just going to get cold while you're brewing? This is huge! This is important! This is... well, I'm excited about it, okay?
Improvement number two: the Fresh Brew features an accurate gauge of water volume. When it reads that you've got 8 cups of water in the brewer's reservoir, it means it. Mind you, we're talking 6 oz. cups of water -- that's the way the coffee world measures a cup [unless you're Bodum and then it's 4 oz.].
Improvement number three: the Fresh Brew is patient. The biggest pain about the manual pour-over method is that you've got to wait to add more water, especially if the coffee is really fresh. Fresh coffee blooms with its charge of CO2! Faced with a full basket of coffee that was literally fresh from the roaster the Zoji didn't overflow, nor did it heave grounds into the water dispensing shower-head. More, the grounds were thoroughly saturated; no dry spots.
So where's the foibles?
Like a great many autodrip brewers the feeder tube that comes from the Zoji's heating element to the shower-head takes a straight path right through the water reservoir. For most brewers this is a game-over situation... the heating element simply can't overcome the heat exchange that occurs en route to the brew-head. On the Zoji, the heating element *does* get hot enough... provided that the water you've placed in the reservoir is not *too* cold.
    Example A: In the office using the "unchilled" spigot on the water cooler, I draw off 48 ounces of water for the reservoir and brew a pot. Throughout the brew cycle water temperatures in the brew basket range between 195 and 200 degrees F. The result is a lovely pot of Ethiopian Yrgacheffe that is sweet, floral and lemony.
    Example B: At home I draw off 48 ounces of water from the water filter in-line with the refridgerator. The temperature of the water in the reservoir is about 40 degrees F. and the resulting temperature in the brew basket never tops 185 degrees F. The result is an icky pot of the very same Yrgacheffe that is bitter, murky and flat.
The moral: mind your initial water temperature and you'll do just fine.
All in all, the Zojirushi Fresh Brew is capable of making 8 cups of coffee that's on a par with manual pourover methods. Better, really, as it insulates the brew-basket to better maintain water temperatures.

The first time I purchased this drive I actually purchase three of them. I showed them to a couple of my friends and they fell in love with them after I would have outline a few things about them. I did not get to use mine since one of my friends had an instant need for it. He has been quite impressed with its performance. I have since bought five more of these drives and is currently using mine. They are neat beyond a doubt and are very easy to use and of course very reliable. I only have one problem: I find the shipping to be a little to high. For this I gave it 4 stars. The drive itself deserve 5 stars.

I've used virtually all the netgear products, with great success.  The WGR614 I setup for a friend, and wow, the range and speed were impressive. I got stong signals upstairs or down, front or back of the house; way better performance than from the older 802.11b-only products.  And it was a snap to setup.  This is by far one of the most refined, well documented, easy to install netgear models I've used (it looks cool too).  And the security features I configured on the wireless, very tight.  Also, no performance hit for the compression that I could measure (in 64bit mode; 128 seems like overkill to me, so i did not comare performance with 128 bit).Anyhow, an excellent product all around. As good, or slightly better than the Linksys equivalent, which I have also used. (PS: If you have broadband with no firewall, it's only a matter of time before a worm or hacker gets at you.  Buy one, seriously.)

I just love these sleep sacks!  My daughter wore them until she was about 7 months old.  I was always so worried about blankets going over her face, but now there's no worries with this invention!!  Not to mention she looks so cute in them!  My daughter is now one, but I am going to get one for my friend who is expecting.  I hope she is as happy as I am with them!

After trying out the Logitech MX518, Logitech G5, Razer Copperhead, and Razer Deathadder, I easily sided with this mouse. This is the mouse that best fits my hand; furthermore, the material used on the side as well as the top is perfect - much more comfortable than the the surface of Logitech's mice.
But to keep this objective, mice are indeed personal things, so it is fair if one does not like this mouse due to aesthetics. I recommend trying out all the mice you are thinking of getting, and see how the shape fits your hand. For my hands, this mouse is simply a flawless fit.
If you purchase this mouse here, the most up-to-date drivers are installed, and there are absolutely no problems with the mouse: plug it in, install drivers from a cd, and you are ready to customize your DPI, etc to your liking.
A highly recommended mouse - give it a chance and try it out at your local electronics store the next time you go - you won't be disappointed!

The trimmer works well in turbo mode for my beard, which I keep fairly short.  I'm not sure why there are two speeds; maybe the lower speed is for different whisker types or for longer lengths.
I'd definitely recommend starting on a higher length setting and adjusting it shorter until it cuts at the desired length. The first time I used it I set it on "2" which turned out to be much shorter than I would have liked.    
I especially like the vacuum feature.  Prior to getting this trimmer, there was hair all over the bathroom sink and counter that had to be wiped up after every trim session.  
My only real complaint is that the unit I received has a flaw in the clear plastic window that covers the "length" number making it hard to see the number. 
I would buy it again.

I have a very small toy fox terrier who has some fear issues.  I got her use to the nail file slowly. (I gave her a treat for sniffing it. I gave her a treat for sniffing it while the motor was on. I gave her a treat for letting me touch her nails with it. I gave her a treat for letting me touch her nails with it on, etc.) All of this took a couple of sittings but now that she is use to it, she wags her tail when I bring it out. It is great.  I never got her use to nail clippers, the vet has to muzzle her, so this is the only thing I could think about using, and it is very fast and effective.

We had an electric self-cleaning box before this one, but it shorted out after a couple weeks, and didn't work well to begin with.  Then we ordered this box, and though it takes some getting used to, it's the best box we could hope for, at a reasonable price.  Really easy to clean.  Despite its high wall, the cats DO manage to kick some litter outside the box, but certainly a smaller amount than most litter boxes.  
I've found that crystal litter works very well to supplement this box for a lazy cat owner such as myself.  It sifts through the box's grating as well as normal clumping litter, if not better, and you don't have to change it nearly as often.

This is my first real electronic brush. After purchasing it and using it for about a week, I can feel a significant improvement of my tooth cleanness and my gum health, it is definitely well worth the price.  I bought a really cheap ($10) electronic tooth brush (more of a vibrating tooth brush) before, and that cheap piece of crap is no where close to the performance of Oral-B Triumph.

I am a discerning consumer.  I have a lot of constructive criticism (i.e., bad things to say) about a lot of things.  Not this brush, though.
My friends had one that they were using on their huskey, and they were all gah-gah over the brush.  So I got one for my mom's german shepherd and, after trying it on him, even got one for my (very short-haired) boxer mix.

Reading some of the reviews made me hesitant, but I went ahead and ordered anyway.  I'm glad I did because the feeder is completely perfect.  The only difficulty was in the operator's error.  Reading the instructions helps big time.  If you can do that, you'll be fine.  You can set the feeding intervals for 1 to 3 times per day.  I like that.

This review is from: Let The Right One In (DVD)
      
First off, let me say, in my mind Let The Right One In is the best movie of 2008 ... period! That said, the DVD release is NOT the theatrical version!!! Read the other reviews if you would like to know what it's about but I want to make a quick comment on the DVD.
First off, the english dubbing is a joke. Turn it off and go with the subtitles. Thre dubbing takes aways from the story and is almost laughable.
Next, the subtitles are not correct and much is left out!!!! If you watched the trailer you see Oskar ask Eli to be his girlfriend ... a sweet moment between 2 tweleve year old kids ... in this version, the subtitle reads ... 'Do I have a chance with you?" WHAT????? What 12 year old talks like that??? The subtitles get worse, and much is left out.
I've seen this movie 3 times in the theater, and reviewed for several websites. I'm sad to say, this DVD is not that movie. By changing the subtitles, and actually removing dialogue, the story has lost much of it innocence and taken the viewer on a trip that is confusing at times ... I guess the the producers of this film didn't feel American Viewers could understand the simple beauty of this story and had to sreamlime the dialouge and make it more adult ... Shame on them!!! I'll be loooking for a European release to purchase ...

When my husband told me that he wanted to buy the Battlestar Galactica-Season One DVD Set for a whopping $50, I said "No way,Jose". But one day, after spending a day out with my girlfriends, and leaving him home with our 2 little girls, I decided to surprise him with it. Needless to say, I, too, became addicted to this wonderful new series. The "New" Battlestar Galactica really does "break the mold". Unlike the original which was much more heavy-handed on the sci-fi side and appealed to a predominantly male audience, this series appeals to both men and women. It is one of the few TV shows where women have equal footing to the men. Mary McDonnell as President Roslin makes it plausible to think that a woman (a "kindergarten teacher" no less) is more than capable to rule the universe. I'm not sure who plays Starbuck (Tricia ___) but she, too, is another strong woman character who is the best pilot among a sea of (hunky) men :-)  I think it was a stroke of genius to make Starbuck a woman in the new series (Starbuck was a man in the original series). Then there's the romance between Sharon and Helo and the sexual tension between Starbuck, Dr. Gaius, and Captain Apollo not to mention the relationshio between Dr. Gaius and Number Six that keeps the screen steaming hot !
In summary, I have to agree with the statement that it is indeed "the best show on television". It has excitement (=lots of explosions), suspense, romance, and most importantly, a stellar cast. I would also argue that the new series is more metaphysical in nature vs sci-fi. I agree that it is a bit heavy-handed with the whole religion thing but it does explore basic human yearnings and hopes and questions about what makes us human.
Last night, we saw the last episode of Season One and I panicked. I commanded my husband to rush out and buy Seasons Two and Two-and-a Half.

This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)
      
I liked this book a lot. I was kind of sad that Edward wasn't in the book as much, but Jacob was okay too. I feel really bad for Jacob in this book because in a way, Bella uses him. When she finds edward, she totally just leaves him. But, nonetheless, "New Moon" is still a good book. It wasn't as good as "Twilight", but if your going to read "Twilight", you need to read "New Moon" too. I can't wait until the next book "Eclipse", comes out!

My old Foreman Grill just died in the middle of grilling some chicken and sent me to the store looking for something new.  I had intended to get the Foreman Grill w/ the removable plates until I saw the Cuisinart Griddler.  I was immediately interested in the fantastic design - aesthetics do matter when an appliance will be sitting on the counter all the time.  Unfortunately, the Foreman Grill is big and ugly (except for the Michael Graves designed Foreman Grill that is only at Target.... and doesn't have removable plates).  
However, I wasn't sure I wanted to spend the extra dough for the better design.  But when I realized I could use it as both a contact grill and a flat grill..... and a panini press (that floating hinge is essential for the panini) and as a griddle I felt it was worth the extra money.  My one concern was that the grease wouldn't drain out properly because there is no tilt to the machine.  I took it home, hooked it up and found that it cooked and drained just excellently.
My one caveat....... it should come with plates to make waffles!  That would make it the ultimate micro appliance.

I installed this in my Windows Vista Home Premium (32-bit edition) desktop computer and it was instantly recognized and updated drivers were downloaded on the first Windows Update session. This is about as plug-n-play as it gets. I live in a neighborhood with public wireless access provided by our association. The external antenna included with this card provides either Very Good or Excellent signal strength (802.11b) at all times. This little PCI card is just a pleasure to use. Install and forget. I much prefer it over a USB dongle wireless for the better antenna and the price is certainly right. Drivers are also available for linux or FreeBSD users as well.

By far the best baby gate I have ever used. Needed to keep baby on one side and dogs on the other yet still be able to walk through.

Highly recommended, and I plan to buy another one once the grandbaby starts moving!

Ok folks, time to get a little personal here. I have been looking for something to trim certain areas that are, how do you say it, sensitive? I wasn't about to us my face Norelco there, nor a blade, so I put this one on my wish list. Lo and behold, under the tree it appeared. I charged it overnight and the next day gave it a test. I started with the #3 comb and carefully trimmed around my, ummm, guys. Not bad; no pulling, no nicks. I continued around, being very careful. Came out pretty good. I then went a little nuts, meaning crazy. I removed the #3 and clipped on the #1. Even better; nice and trim. Wife is happy which make me happy. I have since removed the comb completely and gone with the smooth look. Caution here for the guys, GO SLOWLY! Patience is a virtue! And less painful.

This is the best season so far of a stellar show.  Seasons 1 and 2 were both great, but season 3 goes the extra mile because the writers showed complete fearlessness by letting it get dark.  The bleak sensibility is endemic to the series' circumstances; what we have here is pure existentialism.  What hooked me into Battlestar from the beginning was not just obviously the amazing mini-series, but moreover its ending, when Admiral Adama admits privately that though he's just given a speech to the entire remaining human race about how they're now heading for Earth, he has no idea where Earth is.  This season goes beyond the tit-for-tat space battles with the cylons, which I do love.  The creators had the courage to dig down deep into the premise, to deal with life on board these ships, both human and cylon.  I love that we spend time on board the cylon bay ships, that we see the human class differences and basic social structure perpetuating from the colonies, that we really get the feeling of not just hopelessness that was present in season 2, but of resolve.  Most television programs turn away from that kind of darkness/depth and retreat when confronted with the prospect of boring down into the most organic inner recesses of a given premise.  That retreat is often referred to as "jumping the shark".  The creators of this new Battlestar series are crafting Sartre-esque literature.

Absolutely love this series. Although the gore from the 1st series has been somewhat toned down, the story is just as good. Unlike many American TV shows Dexter does not just ask more questions that it provides answers for.

I cant wait for the next series... :)

The Asus eee PC is the funnest little gizmo I've seen in a while.  I bought it as a satellite unit for my real computer but I find myself using it more often than my powerhouse. It's very light, so I take it everywhere I go, and while it's only 800mhz it's a nimble little thing.  It boots in about 20 seconds, and Xandros is the kindest version of Linux I've seen. When you start out it has these big icons that make it easy for kids to use, but I switched over to "Advanced Mode" which makes it look and act like a Windows clone. This is a nice way to dabble in Linux without making the plunge.  It works well with most common USB add-ons, flash drives, mice and keyboards, even the Xbox 360 HD DVD player. But sadly, there is no iTunes for Linux and when you plug your iPod in, it launches it's mp3 player and plays select songs.  It does charge it at least.   The typewriter is a bit small but it's touchtype-able, (I use just six fingers, my pinkies get a break) After using it a while regular keyboards seem really big. Bottom line, This is a great secondary computer and it seems it was designed with being a back up in mind (It comes with a DVD that requires Windows to play) But it's a lot of computer for the money and it's got an extensive and friendly online community that can walk you through pretty much anything you could want to do with it.  You'll see why it's got a worldwide cult following.  Perfect for students and children.

Let me start out by saying I am a novice to video editing. I read about the problems with .mod files before I bought this camera, but purchased it anyway.  The files were driving me nuts.  I tried everything I read on reviews and nothing seemed to work real well.  I was using a pretty old version of Adobe Premiere Elements.  I read some reviews on this web site  http://video-editing-software-review.toptenreviews.com/.  I downloaded a trial version of the two top rated which were CyberLink PowerDirector 7 and Corel Video Studio X2.  I used the software that came with the camera to put the video files on my hard drive.  The were saved as .mpg file (not .mod files).  Using either of these applications, I was able to edit the files and make perfect DVDs in both 4:3 and widescreen. I preferred Corel Video Studio and purchase it.  It is so easy to use.  So now I don't have any problems with this Canon .mod files at all.  Of course I had to buy new software, but my Adobe version was pretty old anyway.  
In regards to the camera, I really like it because it is small and convenient.  What I don't like is that it is not good in low light and is very shaky when using the zoom.  But for the price I really like this camera

The product is exactly as advertised - virtually smokeless indoor grill. We use ours for Korean barbecue every week. We cook meats and vegetables at the table and then dip in sauces and roll up in lettuce leaves. Great non-stick surface - very easy to clean. Avoid marinating in sweet sauces though since that will create some smoke and a mess on the grill. Better to do a simple marinade (if any at all) and then dip in sauce afterwards. Overall - an excellent indoor grill.

We put this on our wish list for Christmas and received it as a Christmas gift.  I am usually very hesitant about buying anything that some "famous" person has put their name on, just because I think it's kind of shady (I don't like the idea of paying for the "name" and making someone, who already has enough money, even wealthier).  But I read every single review for every single popcorn popper and this one seemed like the best, so I went ahead and put it on our wish list.
We couldn't be happier than we are with this popcorn popper!  It's perfect!  
PROS ~
* It pops probably 95% of the kernels.
* It's fast.
* It's healthier (and not to mention, safer), since it uses hot air to pop the kernels and not oil.
* The popped kernels don't scatter and shoot out everywhere- the plastic top piece is there to "guide" the popcorn into the bowl so you won't end up with a huge mess.  Just make sure you have a big enough bowl!  (My husband made the popcorn the first night we used it and chose a bowl that was WAY too small and so we had some overflowing, whoops! ;-) )
* Price!  If we didn't receive this as a gift for Christmas, I was going to buy it anyway.
CONS ~
* It's pretty loud, although that's to be expected.  If we're watching TV, we wait until a commercial break to make the popcorn.

This review is from: Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series (DVD)
      
I bought the BBC version of this incredible film ~ and, I must say, I'll be buying the Discovery Channel version with Sigourney Weaver narrating VERY soon.  After seeing it on television, I was so enthralled that I couldn't wait to own it.  I hadn't heard Attenborough's voice in quite a few years, and I thought it would be fine, even though I LOVE Weaver's voice with this film.  No disrespect meant to the legendary David Attenborough, a demi-god among naturalists, but his voice is very difficult to listen to at this point, and I find that it's very distracting.  I often press the mute button ~ and I know a lot of other people who were equally disappointed when they bought the BBC version.  I'm certain that this is why Discovery aired this with a change of narrators.

I obsessed on this for a while before buying the product---reading all the reviews here, especially Gina Miller's great review and instructional notes.  
Based on the reviews read here, I wanted to see how long it would take to go from start to finish with this camera.  From the time I met the UPS guy in the driveway to recording a video took approx 2 minutes.  The thing that took the longest was figuring out how to open the battery door (dumb on my part, not the product).   I took a quickie and went to test it on the computer. I had a video uploaded to YouTube within 5 minutes of the UPS guy driving off.  
I don't understand the problems people had, but would recommend contacting Flip/Digitial Technologies in case you just have a lemon.  
Others have commented on the record button, even my fat fingers had no issue with this.
Someone commented that it was too easy to delete.  My camera (Flip Ultra) it took two presses of the button to delete--one to delete and the next to confirm.  This is typical for any piece of technology. 
All I can say is I love it, I love it, I love it!  And, after showing it off on the holidays have managed to sell a few too!

A great proton pump inhibitor.  Every patient is different but in my experience good old Prilosec is often a fantastic choice.  Patients don't need a prescription to buy it and it's been on the market so long that it's proven to be safe and reliable.  Based on my own clinical knowledge it works at least as well as Nexium and many of the other competing PPIs.  Highly recommended for all heartburn and acid reflux sufferers.  If you try it and it doesn't work for you, move onto the more expensive scrips; but try this one first!

Although this is my first netbook, I have experience with several brands and sizes of laptops.  I love this little computer. Before purchasing it I had also researched the ASUS 901, 904HA, 1000HA, the Samsung NC10, Dell mini 9, and Lenovo ideapad. I chose this one because it looked sturdy, had a 6 cell battery option, has wireless b/g/n and bluetooth, 160gb hdd and 1gb ram for a price lower than comparable models in other brands. And its cute. Here are some of my feelings on the product:
1) The lack of an optical drive can be a little inconvenient, but one cannot be expected in such a small package. Given the abundance of online downloads offered by major industries (gaming, virus protection, word documents) this really does not present much of a problem except for playing cds or dvds.
2) I had read in several reviews that the larger 6 cell battery makes the unit "tippy." I have noticed that if I push the screen without holding the keyboard it will lean backwards (keep in mind the entire thing is &lt;3lbs), but I also lounge with this machine on the couch and it has yet to tumble backwards.    
3) While reading reviews on various netbooks I found that a common complaint was their inability to multitask or operate quickly.  I find that this little netbook is able to have several tabs open at once, while downloading and supporting word documents.  With its 1gb ram it is not the fastest, but I certainly have no complaints.  Even with ZoneAlarm Security Suite and ForceField running in the background the Wind still boots up at a snappy pace and surfs the net easily.
4) I admit that I was concerned about the battery life of this machine because I could find very little about its realtime life.  One of the major draws toward the ASUS 904 was that most reviews said that it got around 5 hours. The Wind does not get quite that much, more like 4-4.5 hours while typing and browsing the web. I was surprised that during its initial setup (installation of web browser, virus software, word) it pulled about 3.5-4 hours despite numerous restarts.
5) The keyboard is quite comfortable for my hands. My first laptop had a 12" screen so I am accustomed to slightly smaller keyboards, and I suppose the size of this one might be a problem for some. One feature I particularly like is that my thumb does not hit the touchpad when I go for the space bar as it did on many netbooks. Punctuation buttons are also smaller.
5) Some reviews had mentioned that the touchpad only had one button. Yes, this is true, but the two sides of that button operate as left and right mouse buttons. If you try to push it in the middle nothing happens.  Unlike some other netbooks, the touchpad button does not require much pressure.
6) The wireless networks that I have tried thus far have been easy to connect to and have an excellent connection (not the connection that the computer shows, but the internet works quickly and I am not booted off).
7) The side vents are WONDERFUL! In the past I have had a problem blocking my laptops' vents by putting them on the couch/carpet/my lap.  This is not a problem with the Wind, which vents air through vents on the left side.
One Note: Most pictures show the computer without the battery.  The 6 cell battery does boost the computer up a bit, which was initially of great concern, but I have found that it is not too much to worry about unless you are set on having it flush against the desk.
I have already ordered an additional gb of ram since the machine can support 2gb, and I can't wait to see how it runs with that.

Not a big fan of hair on any part of my body other than my head. And as a brother with kinky hair all over, using razors is not a pleasant option for removing unwanted hair. This product works great for me. I can shave or trim until my hearts content in a fraction of the time it took using razors. The motor is powerful enough and the blades are sharp enough to remove the hair in 2 sweeps the most. What used to take 10-15 mins in the shower now takes 5 mins the most.
I will certainly recommend this product especially for people of color with curly hair like me.

I've had two of these products. The large one was great, my dog Rocco had fun figuring out how to get the food out and became quite a pro at it. It is a good time killer for the dogs as they don't have much to do anyway. Then I forget to take it one time after he was done and he chewed through the rope. Well I liked to so much I go to get another and it's the smaller size. This one had a rubber rope instead of cloth. It didn't move smoothly and Rocco couldn't get ANY treats out of it. That rubber rope just doesn't glide as well as the cloth it sticks. Get the large one, even a small dog should be able to handle it.

This flat iron is worth every penny and then some!  The money you will save on styling products alone makes it a value.
I took my flat iron to a girls beach weekend and did everyone's hair...they all went out to buy this flat iron immediately.  It makes your hair so straight, soft and shiny.  It gets super hot, so it straightens VERY quickly.  Even the curliest of hair will get straight.  
Be sure to use a thermal protecting spray before use...it not only protects your hair but adds to the shine.  
There is NO comparison to a cheap flat iron.  You will NOT regret buying this!

In the past 3 years I have tried MANY pedometers, Omron, Sportline, McDonald's promotional, etc. Omron is the only brand that I have found to be at all accurate. About 3 months ago I read about the newer HJ-112 in Health magazine and knew I had to get one. This pedometer is the most accurate one to date. I love the fact that I can stick it inconspicuously in my pocket or purse and still count my steps. Most others would pop off my waistband at some point and I would lose them. It is amazing how much more aware I am of my daily movement. Every step, and every short walk really adds up. One word of warning: be careful to remember to REMOVE it from your pocket before laundering your pants. I have already sent mine through the washing machine. Fortunately it dried out and still works perfectly, but from now on, I am keeping it inside a sealed Ziploc in my pocket..just in case.

I bought this I-touch for my 13 year old son.  He absolutely loves it.  He used to carry his lap top around to listen to music and search the web. this I-touch is like his lap top except, it fits in the palm of his hand and in his pocket. I highly recommend it

I purchased this dog bed for the first time last year.  I have a Great Dane and expected it to last a few months, if that.  Over a  year later I bought another one through Amazon.  
I cannot believe how well this bed has held up!  The first one was out on our porch (the "mud room.")  The Dane leaps upon it with our Seeing Eye trainee in hot pursuit, and then both will curl up and sleep on it.  Our new one is in the house, where our Dane will take naps or the dogs bounce off before I can remind them of "indoor play!"  
This product has been a terrific value for the price, has withstood more weight than I anticipated, and you can bet I will be buying another for a different room.

My cat had a bad habit of trying to drink out of any source of water that wasn't his water bowl.  If I set down a glass of water, he'd try to stick his face in it.  If I left the faucet dripping, he'd lap at it.  If I left the toilet seat up he'd.... ew.  I bought the Drinkwell Platinum hoping it would be more appealing to him than these other things and it worked great.  After setting up the Drinkwell I put him in front of it and after a couple minutes of mesmerized staring at the fountain he started drinking from it and has used it since.
The noise is pretty minimal.  The pump's motor has a hum that I only notice if I'm right beside the fountain.  Normal refrigerator and air conditioner sounds easily drown it out.  One time after cleaning it was much louder than normal, I took it apart and noticed I hadn't secured the motor tightly to the bowl (it uses suction cups) and it was rattling.  A quick push into place and it was back to its usual quiet operation.  If you're finding the noise to be excessive, that might be something to check.  At higher speeds, the water gurgles as it drops into the bowl but I actually find this sound rather soothing.  If you don't like it just turn the speed down and the water is nearly silent.
Assembly was a snap, and taking it apart for cleaning is equally simple.  I've had no problems with leaks or really with anything.  I like this product a lot and more importantly, so does my cat.  I'd highly recommend it to anybody with a pet.

I purchased the Aspire One as a Christmas gift for my 10 year-old son, whose USB toys and games are slowly taking over our desktop computer. (Plus I want one for myself and wanted to try it out first!) I set it up the night we got it so it would be ready on Christmas day.
Even though I'd been looking at reviews for months, the size of the One astounded me. It's SO tiny! I had some difficulty getting the battery to snap in (one of the metal connectors was slightly bent) but once I got it, I was booted and installing WinXP within minutes. Initial setup, removing the bloatware, and adding our preferred virus software and all my son's games took about an hour. The battery had about 77% when I turned it on, so it was fully charged by the time I finished setting everything up.
The keyboard took a few minutes to get used to, but soon I was typing away with no problem. The screen, surprisingly, is easy to see and read with no straining even with my horrible eyesight. At one point, I had probably 10 windows open and the One never even slowed down. Wifi picked up our home network within seconds and actually showed a few connections that our other computers don't see.
Overall, I couldn't be more pleased with this purchase. I know when my son opens it tomorrow he'll be thrilled to have his own computer that is sized for him. I ordered a Pirates of the Caribbean DVD player case from Target that will serve as his computer bag, as well as the neoprene sleeve sold here on Amazon in case he wants to throw it in his backpack. Our extended family members are already fighting over who gets to use it first!

We have 2 of these!  When we used a banket to swaddle our baby, he was loose in no time.  This swaddle blanket is great and keeps him all tucked in like a little burrito.  Just be sure to velcro it up before washing so it doesn't stick to your baby's good clothes.

With linux and without windows - I got the black one.
Twice the RAM and twice the disk space - duhh. But if you want to slow things down with Windows - buy this one - install windoze - and have the faster box.
Voice recognition is a lot of fun. And this linux package with office, mail, wifi, firefox and free patches and upgrades - means you quit paying after you buy it. But if you choose windows you are just beginning your buying spree.
I like the programming tools of perl, python, ruby and java - access to the command line with a ctl-alt-t sets up the terminal.
I plan to slip this into my backpack (2 pounds) and surf my way between large cities in europe by train. The small keyboard takes time - I am 6'3" have large hands, and am up to about 30 wpm.
What I really like is the 6+ hours batter life. I put this on my headboard and when I want the net, I just reach back and boot - about 30 seconds. With wifi I am up and surfing in a lot less than a minute. When I have done what I wanted, it will shut down in about 20 seconds.
It is about as easy as reaching for a book to read.
You can't go wrong with this little linux jewel - if you want everything - and have the ability to travel easily too - 5 stars *****

At almost a quarter apiece, diapers cost a fortune. But having tested numerous brands on our three kids (read below), we're still loyal to Cruisers.
We've tried Pampers Baby Dry, Cruisers, Luvs, Huggies, Target's store brand, White Cloud (from Wal-Mart), and store brand at Meier (our local supermarket).
My overall experience has been best with Pampers Cruisers, for our boy-girl twins and our older son, who used to drink over 40 ounces a day and whiz like a horse.
Here's my experience with different brands.
Target's store brand just didn't hold as much liquid and weren't as soft as the name brands. 
Meier store brand also leaked.
Huggies Supreme felt nice and were stretchy, but they left little gel pellets on the skin even when we changed diapers frequently. Plus they ran small, so we had to buy a larger size (which come fewer to a package and thus cost more per diaper).
Pampers Baby Dry didn't seem to absorb as quickly or as much as the Cruisers, which for us are pretty leak proof unless my husband changes the diapers (and leaves an entire half of the rear-end uncovered -- I'm talking an entire cheek hanging out).
Luvs (which are made by the same company as Pampers) absorbed a little less and had a funny smell to me when the babies wet them -- and they also didn't come as high up the waist as the Cruisers in the same size. That meant that the waist area of the clothing sometimes ended up wet. And did I mention the slight odor?
Now for the White Cloud. This brand's baby diapers also fell short of the Cruisers. 
BUT for pull-ups for our older son, White Cloud are fantastic. (Pampers pull-ups often ripped at the sides while we were just putting them on, and they aren't Velcro, so they CANNOT be refastened. We loved Huggies pull-ups, but the White Cloud ones are cheaper and are as stretchy and absorbent as the Huggies.)
Between Target and Meier's sales and coupons, and Amazon's subscribe and save, I pay on average between twenty-three cents and a quarter per size 4 Cruiser. My most recent 116-count box at Target cost about twenty-three cents per diaper (that's including tax). 
My most recent 100-count box with special discounts from Amazon ran me 25 cents per diaper. That's also what the 140-count box usually costs me through subscribe and save.

Surviving a heart attack 2-1/2 years ago belatedly made me a real believer in the 10,000 steps a day concept, thanks to the staff in the Coronary Heart Disease Reversal Program at the UC Davis Med Center.  Daily exercise is one important component of their program, and a pedometer is a great tool to help you evaluate how much exercise you're getting, not just in 45 minutes on a treadmill or exercise bike at the gymn, but in your daily activities around your home, yard, and work.  Using a pedometer daily can give you some surprising insights about your life-style.  Who knew, for example, that shopping can qualify as exercise when there's walking involved?  And insights often lead to positive changes.
I bought, used, and discarded a half-dozen cheap, inaccurate, poorly-designed pedometers.  I would run 3 miles and find the pedometer had recorded 92 steps.  I had clips break, cases split from being dropped, I jabbed myself on sharp case corners when bending over.   Then I found the Omron HJ-112 at Amazon and it immediately stood out above all the others.
The HJ-112 is accurate -- within 1-2%, based on my experience.  Accuracy with my other pedometers was more like 5-10%.  And the HJ-112's accuracy is largely independent of wearing position -- clipped on a belt or shoe, hanging from a lanyard, loose in a shirt or pants pocket, it really doesn't matter.  Most other brands need to be clipped at a very specific hip position to get accurate counts.  
The HJ-112 can be easily used all day.  When you're exercising, you'll probably want to use its clip or lanyard.  But pedometers don't really go with business attire so when you're at work or out in public, just pop it out of it's belt clip and put it in a pocket.  Omron says a purse will also do -- I'm skeptical -- but a fanny pack certainly works.  
The clip is quite secure, and the clip attachment to the pedometer itself is excellent: very easy to insert/remove and in two years of use, I've never had it accidently pop off.  The belt clip can work itself loose with repeated flexing if it's sandwiched between two surfaces like abdomen/thigh -- for example, squatting over pulling weeds.  I learned this first hand while squatting doing repairs on the roof of a two-story house. The clip pulled off and the pedometer fell 20 feet onto concrete.  It didn't survive.  I chaulked it up as a life-lesson and ordered a new one from Amazon.  Now when I'm doing that kind of work, I try to remember to carry the HJ-112 in my pocket.  I have dropped the HJ-112 onto concrete and other hard surfaces from more reasonable heights up to 6-7 feet, with no ill effects -- the belt clip is soft, flexible plastic and a pretty-good energy dissipator.  I regularly run 3-4 miles, and I've never had the clip come loose. 
The best feature of the HJ-112 to me is it's Auto-Reset, which I didn't really appreciate until I used the unit for a couple of days.  Each night at midnight, it stores the previous day's step count in memory and resets the current step count to zero.  It stores a week's worth of step counts, which are retrieved with the Memory button, though it doesn't store any of the other computed info (Calories, Miles, etc.).  This really makes it easy to use every day.  No more frustration when you realize mid-afternoon that you forgot to reset the pedometer that morning.  And since it has a clock, it's also able to evaluate steps per minute, which it uses to report "Aerobic steps": 60 steps/minute or higher, or 10 minutes of continuous walking.
The display is easy to read, the clock is remarkably accurate -- better than my iPod's -- though it doesn't handle Daylight Savings Time changes automatically.  The buttons are nicely sized with a good, tactile feel.  The battery lasts 18 months or so, and is easily replaced.
I recommend this product.

This review is from: Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series [Blu-ray] (Blu-ray)
      
When I think of the nature shows I used to watch there were many short clips of things like a leopard running behind a gazelle. One of the best things about this series is their use of modern helicopter-mounted camera systems allowing them to film very long action sequences the likes of which I haven't seen before. The show's large budget and the filmmaker's patience and determination also allowed them to get some impressive footage from remote places.
David Attenborough's voice is pleasing, but I think the actual content of his narration could have been better. Watch out as some US versions feature Sigourney Weaver as a narrator, which may or may not be your cup of tea.
This series is one of those rare items that I think justifies High Definition, so you might want to wait until the HD DVD vs. Blu-Ray war is settled before buying a HD version.
Lastly, I have to mention I couldn't help feeling a bit sad while watching the series because at the rate our planet is going down the drain many of these natural wonders will be gone soon. The HD version might be something to keep for your grandchildren so you can show them what your generation wiped out for ever. Perhaps some viewers today will feel compelled to become "greener" after watching this? I hope so...
P.S.: It's unfortunate that the "making of" documentary is missing from the HD versions. You might want to rent that disc because it's revealing to see how the series was made.

***UPDATE***  No longer the best.  Was the best though.
This is the best typing program you could ask for.  It lets you choose your lesson and youre able to go anywhere in the program whenever you want.  This is good for reviewing parts that youre not ready to go past yet.  Everything is set up how it should be, i've been learning very quick from this program.  It's literally 10 times better than mavis beacon which is a piece of krap.  Mavis beacon makes you start from the beginning, and will not let you go back or review lessons, also the design and format are very poor, the word for it is "garbagey".  All other programs I've tried have come way short of this one too.

Originally purchased one for family who live in a rural area, using bottled gas to power their oven.  Their oven takes forever to heat.  While waiting to hand deliver our present, our toaster oven went and we purchased one for ourselves.
It is phenomenal.  
The convection saves time and does a wonderful job.
It takes approximately 5 minutes or so to heat.
Using it as a regular oven is a bonus.  Less energy and always quicker.
It can also supplement your regular oven on big cooking days.
The toaster settings get some getting used to but now I am quite pleased.  
The broiler produced wonderful lamb chops.
The control panel is a joy to operate.

Like ususal, the characters are very well developed and the stories and CG is very good.  The last episode (Pegasus) of this set will definitely make you go out to get Season 2.5.  My recommendation:  Get 2.5 right away and watch Pegasus on 2.5 because it has more information than the Pegasus episode on 2.0.

I have two short-haired cats in a small apartment and, between vacuuming sessions, I am always on the lookout for hair-bunnies creeping up in corners or underneath counters.
I wasn't sure if my cats had enough hair for the FURminator to be any more effective than my other grooming tools.
However, I have been all-out awed by its performance.  My other grooming tools (which I thought were pretty good) just weren't pulling out the dandery undergrowth that makes their coat look dull and unkempt.  I saw an immediate improvement in their coat texture - much silkier.  My cats haven't been picky about grooming tools in the past but this was the first time I used something with metal teeth.  Not a problem, they sit in their spots and happily bat their tails throughout the entire grooming session.
The FURminator is my hands-down favorite purchase of 2008.  The amount of fur whisps I've seen on my hardwood floor has been reduced to nearly nothing.  No hairbunny surprises in ages.
I was surprised to find something on Amazon with more than 400 reviews and such high ratings.  It really is as good as the hype and well-worth the price.

I bought the Flip Ultra a few days ago, and I haven't been able to put it down.  Like most parents, I have a miniDV camcorder, but I haven't been using it to take as many movies of my kids as I should have, so I bought this to keep on me at (almost) all times.  Here is what I have found so far:
Pros:  It's truly pocket sized.  It starts up in seconds, and operation could not be any simpler.  The video seems slightly better than the movie mode on my digital camera, and the sound is better.  Because it's cheap (I paid sixty bucks), I'm not worried about damaging it, and as long as you are somewhat aware that there is a lens, there is not much to break anyway.  The software, once it's working, is also very simple, and yes, the program outputs normal *.avi files.  Indoor light makes acceptable videos.  Schoolroom lighting was perfect.  Outdoors, when the sun was low in the sky, I got a lot of washout (to be fair, it would have been tough for any camera).
Cons:  It's hard to make a non-shaky video.  There is no Electronic Image Stabilization or anything like it, and the thing is so light that it's tough to hold it steady.  That little screen on the back is your only indicator of whether or not you are holding it steady.  There is no memory card slot, just internal memory.  
I had some annoying problems with the software, which is built in to the camera.  The first time you plug it in, it installs onto the computer.  It immediately recognized that there was an update available, so I downloaded that and installed it.  The problem came when the computer wanted to update the camera - my camera was filled with video, so it said it would do it later.  Fine.  I removed my files, fired the program back up - and it installed the update to the camera.  Then I was barraged with requests to reinstall the update - constantly - when the camera was plugged into the computer.  I had to uninstall the software and reinstall from the camera.  Now, it still wants to re-install the program when it gets plugged in, but it only asks once now, and I can live with that little annoyance.
So know what you are getting - your normal camcorder will take better videos, but you probably won't have it in your pocket when something spontaneous happens.

The whole concept of Flip Video is simplicity. Open the box, drop in the included (regular) batteries, shoot, review, download, done! The camera works great!! If you're looking to become the next Spielberg, or you want to film an 8-hour epic that you plan on boring your family and friends with, this camera is NOT for you. But if you want a fun and easy to use device that fits in your pocket, you'll love this. The video quality is very good and makes great videos in a normally lit room, with no need for one of those spotlights that blind the subject. You also have the option of saving still pictures from your videos, and picture quality is good. Emailing your videos is also easy. There is no software disk or manual needed. Cables are even included so you can watch them on your TV. Even the product registration is simple. All you do is send an email to the company with your particulars and it's done. No surveys and boxes to click and unclick.
I use a MacBook, and I did experience some downloading issues initially. But Flip technical support is superb! I received a response and solution to my problem within hours of sending an email.  
I rated this highly because of the simplicity, quality, fun factor and excellent technical support. If this is what you want, get a Flip. If you plan on filming the next Hollywood blockbuster, spend big bucks on another, expensive alternative.

I purchased this aluminum MacBook to replace the white plastic MacBook I acquired in June of 2006. I enjoyed using my white plastic MacBook, but when I learned about the manufacturing process used to construct the new aluminum MacBook, I realized it was time for an upgrade!
I have read the unenthusiastic reviews despairing the removal of a Firewire port in the aluminum MacBook. I certainly understand that to some people Firewire connectivity is essential. I am not one of those people. I have never used the Firewire port in my white plastic MacBook. I guess I'm just behind the times; I don't even own a video camera.
I have also read the negative comments about the glossy screen. I like the glossy screen because everything looks a little sharper as compared to the matte screen of my white plastic MacBook.
The new MacBook has a glorious aluminum case and the computer is significantly faster than my 1.83Ghz 2gb RAM white plastic MacBook.
This machine is a winner.

As I know, the books Stephanie Meyer wrote was directed to a "teen audience"...maybe that was her demographic in the begining, but in the end, the story of Bella and Edward and scored across the board. My grand daughter read the stories following me...my daughter and then my grandson. Our ages range from 16 to 59. We all fell in love with the stories and the movie. 
Just to let anyone know who may read this...both of my grandchildren are 4.0 students and my daughter and I are both professionals. We all have many friends of various ages and work stations who have read and enjoyed the books as well as the movie...So..it is not just a "teen movie."
In addition we are looking forward to the sequel New Moon and hope that Weitz does the exceptional job that Hardwicke did. 
When you have such a detailed story how do you pick the primary pieces and try to fit them together without having a six hour movie. I think that she did a exceptional job and Weitz will really have his work cut out for him in the sequel.
As you can well ascertain, I am a fan of the books and movie, and look forward to more work by Meyer, Hardwicke and the beautiful young cast of Twilight.

After reading the other reviews, I took a risk and bought this product to help restore peace and quiet in our back yard. Two large neighbor dogs go insane any time we move in our own yard. After asking politely for help from the dog owners, we took matters in our own hands.
We hung the "bird house" from a tree near the fence where the offending pooches perform their annoying chorus. While installing, both ran over, ready to start the concert and - "What's this?" Both looked confused and immediately ran to the other end of their yard. 
Since that time, they not only have stopped barking, they don't even come to our side of the fence anymore! Peace at last!!
Well worth it; works like magic.

I bought this computer for web and email while on the road. I am totally pleased with my purchase and would recommend it for everyone who needs a small work computer for the road.
I've upgraded the memory to 2G and added an office program and several other small office solutions programs. The speed and comfort of running several programs at once is great, no problems at all. The battery life is beyond anything I've experienced, a good 6+ hours. The connectivity options are super and I've used them all without a hitch. The key board actually fits my hands better than the standard, and I haven't yet had any problems with typing.
I love the 10" screen and the resolution qualities are super, along with the easy controls. Taking this thru security at many airports is a breeze, as it fits nicely in my backpack. Compared to the 14" that I use to carry the Samsung is a dream come true.
I agree you won't like this computer if you load it up with High demand video or picture programs, but to go and download videos and pics, this is a great computer.
The samsung NC10,for what it was created to do,is the best of the mini computer sector. For the price you can't get a better computer.

This show is the best.  I really don't need to say more but I will.  This is by far the best show on TV right now and this DVD set is a credit to the series.  I will admit that some of the episodes of series 2.5 are a little lackluster and strained the overall product more than make up for a few less than stellar episodes.  Extras like the commentaries, extended Pegasus cut, Deleted scenes, and the R&amp;D skits make this DVD buy worth every penny.  This is not a rent, it is most definitely a buy, keep, cherish and witch over and over and over and over.  OK maybe that's a little over the top but it is worth dropping a few bucks to get it.

This gate works really well for all level surfaces.  We found it didn't work well at the top of stairs, however, because you need a little leverage to press the foot pedal enough to open the gate.  Unfortunately, if you're on the stair below the gate, you have to lift your leg too high to really get the leverage to open it.  
I would highly recommend it for all doorways, however.  We love it!

First of all, here is the manual, because this thing wins the award for the least intuitive device I've ever used:
http://www.smarthome.com/manuals/61860.pdf
It does what it says what it will do until your pet figures out how to "steal" food.  My cat is quite dumb so it took her a couple months to figure out that she could reach her paw up in the food tumbler and swipe food out
I'm now quite happy though because I drilled two holes above the food hole, put some fat screws in there.  Now her arms are bigger than the hole.  The manufacturer should have figured this out for us though so we wouldn't have to modify our own product.  (there may be a newer model, i didn't bother checking).  I've had this for about 10 months and all the batteries work fine, so that's nice.
Overall, if it exists, I would recommend buying another product that doesn't have the food theft factor.

I am really pleased with the Cuisinart DCC-1200.  I have had it for about a month and I love it.  We got the black and stainless model and it looks great on the counter.
This coffee maker is easy to use and is constructed well.  I spent a few minutes reading the manual and find it easy to use all of its features.  I like how hot the coffee is - hotter than any other maker I have tried.
I highly recommend the DCC-1200.

We've used the sleepsack since our daughter was born.  No worries about blankets getting wrapped near her head/mouth.  The last few months we haven't used one as it was summer but now that it is cooling off (and we found her with her blanket bunched under her head half covering her face) we decided it's time to buy more (in larger sizes now that she is 16 months old).
It definitely brings peace of mind regarding safety and that your baby is nice and warm (but not too warm thanks for the armless sack) during the night.  Definitely worth the money!

Eclipse is a quick read, a great story and full of the characters we all love!  The conflict in this book is more confined to the end, but it's still exciting.
We get to see more of the Cullen family and we learn more about Edward and Bella and their relationship.
I read through this so fast I can't remember if it's really my favorite of the Twilight novels or if I just remember some great parts and think it's my favorite.
A definite must read!!

Wish I had this coffee maker years ago.  I have a Senseo single serve coffee maker, which I purchased several years ago.  I have enjoyed it but it has always been a bit messy when disposing of the pod after each use.  That is the reason I have never placed it on the night stand.
The Keurig B60 is residing on my night stand.  It enables me to have a fresh cup of my favorite coffee each work day morning.  Because it only takes a few minutes for it to brew a fresh hot cup of joe while I am trying to wake up each morning, I don't have to stagger into the kitchen and stand there, bleery eyed, waiting for the Senseo to do its job.
No matter where you place the B60, you will always get a fresh, hot cup or mug of your favorite K-Cup coffee in minutes.

I'm a sucker for promotions on Oprah, and when miss Paltrow came on the show talking about Tracy Anderson's workout, I became curious. I am a fit person but at 5'2" I bulk up really easily whenever I weight train. I've always just had to stick with cardio if I want to lose weight, but still it never keeps me very toned. My wedding is in 3 months, and my problem area is my arms, so I figured I'd give it a shot and purchased the DVD. It's my only workout DVD that I own and in 2 weeks, I've received more compliments on my figure than I could have imagined. I noticed that I'm leaner in the mirror, and my shoulders have more definition, but I didn't think it was noticeable to anyone else. The feedback has been very encouraging, and the results are pretty amazing. I do the workout 5-6 times a week first thing in the morning. At first, my form wasn't very good... the leg and arm workouts are brutal. But after a week, I noticed that I'm able to control more, and really get into it. For the first time this morning I actually completed the arm workout without stopping, which was a huge accomplishment for me. There are some annoying things that she does, like not really count or keep track of how many reps she does, and one side may get a few more reps than the other. So I have just learned to alternate... one day I start with my left, and the next it's my right, so hopefully that evens out. I would recommend this workout DVD for anyone who is really looking to tone up without bulking. I would not say it's the only form of exercise you need to lose weight, you still need to do cardio and eat well, but I'm pretty sure you'll be amazed with the results in a short time.

This review is from: Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series (DVD)
      
In this film, one can see snap shots of a number of rare and near extinct animals.  BBC has utilized this opportunity to emphasize how human activities has endangered all sort of living organisms on earth.  This message is loud and clear.  It is a fabolous film to show during family gathering or to be used as educational tool for kids.  
Different chapters are organized by habitates: deserts, rainforest, tundra, poles, caves...etc.  This organization allows the DVD to merge the knowledge of animals together with knowledge of geograhy into one relatively coherent film.  It might be a bit hard for kids to follow and to absorb 100% of material though.  
I appreciate and the seperate part of documentation that details the challenges the crew faced.  The script in this part is a bit too hard sell for my taste, hence one less star.
Haven't view the discovery channel or national geography films that are similar, so no comment about which one is better.  However, with this one alone, I highly recommend this, especially if you have a high definition TV.

I once had a Fresh Flow and it quickly got dirty mostly with cat hair. The other reviews are correct in saying it is very difficult to clean.
I just received a fountain called The Bubbler which was recommended by another reader at Amazon. Fantastic product and I would highly recommend getting this instead of the Fresh Flow or the Drinkwell.
It does NOT have water filtration, which is fine with me. I think the other two fountains have to have filters to help with all the cat hair that gets stuck in it.
Instead, The Bubbler has a base, a one-gallon reservoir, an external pump, and a hose. Those are all the parts! The reservoir is cleverly designed so I DIDN'T SPILL A DROP while placing the reservoir on the base. It looks like both main parts are heavy plastic and dishwasher-safe. I'm sure the small hose can be run under hot water with soap and that does it for cleaning. Since the pump is external and doesn't actually come into contact with the water...it doesn't clog and NEVER NEEDS TO BE CLEANED.
The pump simply pushes air to two hoses that emerge from the bottom of the base. This creates bubbling action in the bowl. It's very quiet from fifteen feet away while I type this, I can barely hear it. It sounds like a far-off hum from here, and something bubbling up close. The pump doesn't make any noise that I can hear AT ALL!.
I needed a fountain because my kitties don't drink enough water. I don't care if it's filtered water or not, I don't mind cleaning the bowl. The Bubbler creates the movement that is already attracting them to drink more. So far I'm very pleased.
Unlike the other reader who commented, I was not able to find The Bubbler at the grocery store for $15. I paid about $32 including shipping and I'm very happy with the results.

This review is from: Wall-E (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)
      
Well, what more can I say that hasn't been said already?
This movie was brilliant! Excellent, even though there's little dialogue (at least for the first 1/2 of the movie)....To be honest, "Less was definitely More" in this movie. As a matter of fact, this movie could have done just fine without any human dialogue, and it still would have been a great film. Very emotional movie....The writers &amp; producers of this movie did an outstanding job.
This movie has an incredible storyline, and certainly makes you think about our lives (as humans), and where we're headed, in the future, if we don't get our acts together. Hopefully, if we ever get to that point, we'll have E.V.E. &amp; Wall-E there to help save us.
This was one of Pixar's best films.
Gonna watch it again right now!.....no, really......I am!

I've been very happy with this product thus far.  It heats up to the level necessary to tame my thick and frizzy hair, and doesn't dry out my hair as it straightens.  My only potential concern is for people who don't need as much heat as I do - there appears to be no way to adjust the temperature.  I really appreciate the smaller size as well, since my last straightener was considerably larger and heavier.  I would recommend this product to my friends!

I've been using the CBEFM for 4 months now and it has been a great tool for predicting ovulation.  I have found it to be a less stressful procedure than taking my BBT everyday, and it is highly accurate.  For those of you with irregular cycles, this is a wonderful tool to help pinpoint those fertile days!  The monitor and sticks can get expensive, but I think they are worth it.

We've been through at least a dozen different varieties of baby gates over the years as we have a 7 yr old and a 1 yr old and many pets.  By far, this is the best we've seen.  Its solidly constructed, easy to install, can be positioned in a number of places that most gates just won't work and is only slightly more expensive than less effective models.  I don't know anyone with tots that doesn't walk around the house carrying something when they need to go into the gated area -- laundry baskets, baby, etc.  With this gate, no need to put anything down to open it.    Just step on the pedal latch and press your knee against gate.  (It'll be obvious when you see it).  The gate swings open without needing your hands.  Also, the pedal requires a significant amount of weight be applied so its safe and the tots can't accidentally open it.  We bought one initially with the extension to fit a very awkwardly positioned high-traffic area where no other gate could be installed.   Now we're buying a second gate for another spot because it solves the baby-containment problem so well.

I cannot begin to say how much I love this show.  This was a collaboration of dream actors, writers and crew, and it shows in every episode.  I miss Alex O'Loughlin's handsome face on television so this is a present to those of us waiting for his return in 2009; with Twilight and True-Blood so prominent, this show was a part of a triad of quality vampire-themed programs that hit a fantasy nerve with viewers. As the main character, Mick St. John, says, it's a thrill ride that never ends...!

This review is from: Iron Man [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)
      
Marvel Comics, unhappy with the lack of creative control and its share of profits in the films made by other studios based on their characters, recently started their own film division. The first film from this endeavor, "Iron Man" starring Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges and Terrence Howard, is a lot of fun, and sure to generate a number of sequels based on the huge amount of money made on opening weekend. This is good for Marvel Films because they will need to use some of the profits from this film to offset the inevitable loss for their next film, "The Incredible Hulk" starring Edward Norton, Tim Roth and Nick Nolte, due later this summer. Watch the trailer and you'll see what I mean.
But I digress. "Iron Man".
Tony Stark (Downey, Jr.) is a brilliant man who grew up in his father's shadow, an inventor, Starks Sr. &amp; Jr. both learn they can make any of their ideas a reality Sr. was one of the people who helped build the Atomic bomb, so it probably comes as no surprise that Stark Industries sells weapons; weapons of every size, shape and megaton. When Tony comes of age, he takes over the company from his father's right hand man, Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) and the two work together, as a team - Stark handles the inventions, Obadiah handles the business side of things. Stark takes a trip to Afghanistan to demonstrate his newest weapon, a huge missile and bomb combo designed to level mountain ranges. Driving back, his convoy is attacked and he is taken prisoner. During the attack, Tony is injured and a fellow prisoner fits him with a magnet saving his life. When Tony wakes up, he learns his captors want him to recreate the weapon he just demonstrated, for their use. But he comes up with a better idea and creates a new power supply for the magnet, allowing him to move without a car battery at his side. He then uses a list of equipment procured from his captors to create an iron suit, complete with weapons, to wear and escape captivity. When he returns home, he realizes he can improve the suit, its powers and its abilities. Now that Tony has seen his products create death, mayhem and damage, he wants to do some good in the world. Naturally, Obadiah is a little disappointed to learn of the companies new, less profitable business plan. But Colonel Rhodes (Terence Howard) is happy to see the change is his longtime business associate and friend. And Stark's personal assistant, Pepper Pots (Paltrow) is also a little more attracted to her boss. After a test run of his new, sleeker, more powerful suit, Stark realizes he left some unfinished business behind in Afghanistan. Then, some trouble begins to brew back home.
Directed by Jon Favreau ("Elf", "Zathura" and an actor with many credits) combines unconventional casting choices, very good acting, an intelligent screenplay and some kick a** special effects to create an enjoyable movie going experience and a great kick off to the summer season. This is one of those occasions when you can almost anticipate the sequel, when you can't wait for it. Now that they have all of the exposition concerning the creation of the superhero out of the way, the sequel can get down to business and throw us directly into the story, keeping us on the edge of our seats. I am an eternal optimist.
"Iron Man" is a lot of fun and more intelligent than you might expect. Robert Downey, Jr. seems like an unconventional choice to play a superhero, and he is, but he is actually the perfect choice for the role of Tony Stark. A rich, highly intelligent industrialist, Tony works hard, spending a lot of time and money coming up with new ideas and inventions, making them work, making his company all the more rich and powerful. But he also plays hard. Living in a fancy, modern house on a hill overlooking the ocean in Malibu, Tony has state of the art everything in his house, allowing him to spend as much time as possible working and playing. He is also a lothario, sleeping with and hitting on as many women as he possibly can. He picks up a reporter in Vegas and the next morning, in his house in Malibu, she is awakened by the house `opening' the curtains to his bedroom, his assistant, Pepper, holding her dry-cleaning. Tony also has an advanced computer system, helping him and allowing him to run with ideas and to continue to develop them. This system allows him to view 3-D holographic depictions of his ideas, removing and adding pieces at will.
As we get to know Tony, we realize he lives a secluded life. Allowed to work and play, as he wants, he knows little of the effects of his work on the real world, and leaves the running of his business to Obadiah. When he travels to Afghanistan, his eyes begin to open as he witnesses firsthand what his work actually does, the consequences of his life, and sees a little window through which he can move to start making a positive impact on the world. But this change in his life doesn't please everyone and provides Iron Man with a formidable foe, the Iron Monger.
When Stark is taken prisoner in Afghanistan, he uses all of his previous research and designs to build a new and improved power supply to help keep him alive. And he also creates a prototype of Iron Man, allowing his escape from the men who so desperately want him to create a new weapon for them. This is a great illustration of the character's intelligence and cunning, making all of the previous information about him we have been bombarded with seem very real.
Downey, Jr. uses his well-known sarcastic attitude and delivery to bring life to Stark's sheltered persona. Because he lives in a cocoon, and has a lot of money, he doesn't realize how the real world works where he lives and plays as he pleases. This same persona also helps the character bring humor to the proceedings and make the story all the more memorable. He proves to be an excellent choice for the role and his career will definitely benefit from the success of this film and it's inevitable sequels.
Favreau and his team have created a rich, decadent playground for Stark to live in. His computer system uses advanced holographs and voice commands, he drives the best, fastest cars and his house is run by a computer system that recognizes Tony and Pepper, and addresses them by name. But more importantly, Favreau has assembled a cast that can act, a group of actors more commonly associated with Academy Award nominated and critically praised films. These actors make their characters richer, more interesting, more watchable and more memorable.
Gwyneth Paltrow plays Pepper Pots and she is, by far, the weakest of the supporting characters. There is a brief hint of an unrequited love between employee and employer, made more overt during a very good scene set at Walt Disney Concert Hall. But Paltrow is wasted in the role. While she does bring a memorable respectability to the role, making it better, her skills weren't needed for Pepper Pots. When she becomes endangered (which is inevitable, face it), she doesn't stand around shrieking, but she doesn't prove to be extremely strong either. And the flirtatious relationship between Tony and Pepper is generally ignored with the exception of the one scene mentioned earlier and a few passing references. Hopefully, this area will be expanded and improved upon in the next installment.
Jeff Bridges plays Obadiah Stane, Stark's father's business partner who helps run the company until Tony becomes old enough to take the reins. Tony continues to work with Obadiah, leaving the day to day operations in his hands, freeing him up to work on his creations. Obadiah is a very smart man and makes the company very profitable. Naturally, he feels threatened by Tony's change in attitude and works behind the scenes to ensure the company will remain as profitable as ever. He also steals Tony's plans and begins work on his own version of Iron Man, seeing the potential in such a lethal weapon. Obadiah has spent his adult life selling weapons, becoming rich as a result. So in his mind, lethal is good.
Obadiah is a lot more twisted and crooked than I am letting on, but discovering the extent of this is half the fun.
Terrence Howard plays Colonel Jim Rhodes, a longtime associate of Tony, who acts as a liaison between Stark and his government contacts. When Stark is taken hostage, Rhodes leads the rescue mission. When Stark becomes Iron Man, Rhodes helps him out in various ways.
As you watch the story unfold, you get the sense Howard, like everyone else in the film, is having a fun time. He plays the role with a certain sense of tongue-in-cheek but this quality is played subtlety, which makes the role all the more appealing and real.
"Iron Man" is a very good, very enjoyable, fun summer film. The actors have a lot of fun and it translates to the screen. The performances, in combination with a well-written screenplay, great special effects and a believable universe help to make "Iron Man" one of the more memorable summer films in many years. I can easily see this character becoming a franchise to challenge "Spiderman" in popularity.

My wife starting snoring a few years ago.  I'm a pretty light sleeper &amp; it soon got to the point where I was sleeping almost every night in another room.

Which it came with a manual though for people that are not too into computers and the "string" that comes with it is useless, i wouldn't put it in my keychain, it looks like it can brake any second. if it would come with something stronger though would be better. The drive itself is great though.

My son is not 41 pounds yet, but he does not fit in size 6 diapers anymore. I guess it's because he is chunkier than he should be for his height. I am so glad that Pampers invented size 7 just as my son started needing them. Now I don't have to buy medical diapers for him. My son is severely disabled, and I need to buy diapers for him until he is 3 years old. Then the insurance will cover them. Thanks, Pampers, for making size 7. I only wish I could get them in any store!
I think the Pampers work great. My son hasn't had a leaky Pamper yet, and believe me, my son has a tendency to have leaky diapers from time to time.

The great benefit of this camera is that it's so easy to use and that everything comes in one package. There's no need for extra cables, chips, software - anything really, because it's all inside this cute little box. The image quality is obviously not going to compare to its 3 Chip cousins, but that's not what this is for. Compared to a single chip camera costing 5x as much - the image holds up. I'm even impressed by the quality of the onboard mic, and I'm an audio professional. Bottom line - this is one great product that you'll be happy to play with long after the box is thrown away. This will be one of the hot products of the holiday season and a sure fire hit for all the YouTube wannabe stars. Pure Digital got it right this time. Can't wait to see what they come up with next.

This review is from: Watchmen (Hardcover)
      
Watchmen will probably take a couple reads for you to be able to grasp the entire essence of what it is.  It is a political work of art riddled with original stories and characters.  The thing that works for Watchmen, is that even though there is so much information passing through the pages, all of it is very valuable as it combines into a piece as a whole.  The story reads like an actual screenplay and it definitely feels like it comes off the pages.
Our characters instantly make themselves favorites in the comic book world.  Alan Moore couldn't have imagined better ideas.  He kind of makes fun of the superhero idea and slams our brains with the reality of it.  This realistic approach to superheroes totally gives comic readers a new perspective and that makes this novel extremely valuable.
I won't get too much into the politics because I wasn't alive at the time.  I believe, however, that it gives the book a much bigger importance by tangling itself into the real world.  This stuff is very interesting for most readers.
To conclude, I would say that this novel is a benchmark in graphic novels.  It is a cornerstone to the comic world.  I am very scared about the attempt to adapt this to film.  Zack Snyder is an excellent director, but as he stated "The movie is unfilmable." I have high hopes, but with such an original novel I don't know if they will be able to hollywoodize it.  Alan Moore is one of the greatest writers of his time.  And this novel is his masterpiece.

Natrol Acai Berry 1000mg per daily serving- 60 caps
  I am very happy with it. I don't see it as a diet aid, but is chock full of good Vitamins.
  And as always... Amazon gets your order to you in good shape and and in good time.
  I also just got some books from them... and they are better than I even thought they would be.

I had just installed a dual-boot (XP and Vista) in my new computer and could not get my ethernet to operate in the XP mode. I installed all the drivers I could find and it would only work in Vista. I plugged this little gem into a USB and now can access the internet in either mode through the wireless connection.

Finally got around to buying a non-disk music player, and for the price this one is a winner - once you figure out that you should use Media Player (in Windows) to 'synchronize' the desired music files to the player. I had to do some web surfing to get this info; but it works - and sounds great. Well worth the price.

Although most of the review here are of HJ-112 which does not connect to the PC, HJ-720ITC can connect to PC.  I needed to install software first, but it was easy.  The data transfer from the unit to the PC is also just pushing a button.  The software is solid enough and do not cause stability issue so far.  The good point of the software is that it shows hourly, dayly, weekly and monthly steps I made.  Especially, hourly step count is interesting because it reminds me of what I was doing at that time; one day I worked until 2AM midnight and went home, restarted working 6AM after some sleep.(what a hard worker I am!).  It is shown as step bar chart.
It is also motivating to see such graph for work out.  
Highly recommended.

I was able to get this cat toy for $4.69 on Amazon and just noticed that they bumped up the price.  My cats love this thing!  I took it out of the box and they immediately took a liking to it.  The kitten goes on top of the cardboard thing and uses it for scratching.  My other cat, I can tell she wants to play with it too, but let's the kitten go on it first.  She'll play with it once a while when the kitten is done.
The cats also went crazy over the catnip that it came with.. they really love this toy.  I'm planning on buying another one to give as a present to my brother who also has 2 cats.

I purchased this product for my wife, so I can only base my opinion on her comments. She takes very good care of her teeth, and has purchased several power toothbrushes over the years. She is constantly looking for high quality products. She says the Sonicare toothbrush is clearly the best she has ever used. She recommends it highly.

When I first saw this thing I ridiculed it, I was not to keen in accepting the specs and the reliability but the more I read up on it and viewed more videos and specs on it, the more I wanted it. I now ave it, added two gigs of ram and even added a portable hard drive for extra storage. I have not been disappointed with this purchase, matter of fact I even get the occasional jealous eye from other laptop owners always asking the same thing: how much, where i can get one and can I try it out? The speed on this EEE PC is pretty good considering I have thrown a few heavy apps, mainly Photoshop and Mixmeister and I have even downloaded some heavy files. I have put this threw the ringer and still it keeps up. If setup right, you can in theory get the 7 hours of promised battery life although I have only been able to squeeze about 5 but that is plenty for me. I very happy with this purchase, might even consider a later model sometime in the future

I'm no computer expert so take that into account.  But I love this little netbook.  I wanted something easily transportable, inexpensive, but with a keyboard that wouldn't drive me crazy.  My husband and I checked out the 8 &amp; 9" netbooks in a couple of stores &amp; I knew those wouldn't work for me because of the small keyboards.  But when I saw that the Asus keyboard is 95% of a normal laptop keyboard that made the decision for me.  My only issue with it is the location of the right shift key.  I'm learning, but now that I know I can remap it I'm going to try to do that instead.  The HE fixes that keyboard issue but for the same $ we added the OCZ 2 GB PC2-5400 667 MHz DDR2 Value SODIMM Laptop Memory (OCZ2MV6672G) to double the memory instead.  Bluetooth wasn't important to me, and I wanted white. So the HA was the right choice for me. 
People who complain about the track pad apparently aren't using it properly, mine works just fine when you press on the angled edge, not straight down.  I do use a mouse most of the time but the track pad works just fine when I need it.
Overall I'm very, very happy with it.

I'm really looking forward to this DVD release. A lot of "Battlestar Galactica" fans have had negative things to say about Season 2.0, Volume 2. I agree with some of the criticism, but not all of it. The one real problem I have with this show is that most episodes are very predictable and many of the storylines just keep recycling themselves. Almost every episode in this season seems to revolve around Adama, Starbuck, or Apollo being in mortal peril...that gets kind of old after a while. However, in spite of that, this is still a great show. It's so FRACKIN' INTENSE! A lot of important things happened during this season involving Adama's clash with the commander of the Pegasus ship, President Roslin's terminal cancer diagnosis, Starbuck and Apollo's personal relationships and professional development, Gaius Baltar's rise to power, and the cylon's infiltration into what is left of the human race. 
I don't want to spoil the season for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, but there are plenty of "shock and awe" moments to look forward to. Beloved characters will die, surprise relationships will form, and the season finale cliffhanger is unlike anything you've ever seen in the series before! NOTHING will prepare you for what happens during the last 15 minutes of the final episode!
I can't wait until the new season debuts this fall, but until then, I'm looking forward to catching last season's episodes for the second time with this DVD set.

Not one to usually jump on any bandwagons, I felt it would be an injustice not to come and add my own glowing review of the Breville wok. Since opening the box, we've not gone one single night without cooking in it. It heats (and I do mean HEATS!!!!) instantly and the non-stick surface makes cooking a quick and easy breeze. It keeps meat melt-in-your-mouth tender and the veggies retain their color, taste and texture thanks to the uber-high temps and quick cooking. Clean up is a cinch thanks to the removable base. AND YOU CAN PUT IT IN THE DISHWASHER! Unbelievable. Usually you'd pay 3 times what this wok sells for on Amazon for a piece of cooking equipment of this caliber. I'm telling all my friends to buy one, and if you're into healthy, quick, easy cooking, then this wok is a must-have for your kitchen.

I own a KA Artisan Series 5-Qt. Stand Mixer in "Blue Willow."  I am a casual baker and am relatively new in the kitchen and prior to making this purchase, I did quite a bit of research on stand mixers.  I found that the questions you have to ask yourself prior to making this purchase are:
(1)  Do you really need one, and, if the answer is yes, then;
(2)  Is this a one-time purchase, and;
(3)  Which stand mixer actually *fits* your needs?
Though I was tempted to get a big 6-Qt professional, bowl-lifting, super cool mixer, I realized that I generally cook for two people and that I would not need to ever really mix 14-cups of flour or 8 pounds of potatoes.  Even if I did, I'd be doing it in smaller batches anyway. So that brought me back to my senses and I considered the KA Artisan.
Comparatively:  
Oddly, it only has 325 watts of power.  Other stand mixers of this size offer up to 500 watts; the KA 6 Qt. Pro offers 525 watts and a bowl "lift" function.  I don't know if this makes a huge difference, but my KA stands up to whatever I put in it.  I use it to make mostly cookie and bread doughs.  It comes with three accessories: flat beater, dough hook, and wire whip.  The flat beater is very versatile and I have really appreciated not having to wrestle with my crappy hand-mixer when mixing things like softened cream cheese.  I can throw it all into the bowl at once and walk away to start something else.
Cleanup:
It's a snap.  While I tend to still get flour all over "The Fuselage," as I call my mixer, it wipes off in a jiffy because of the sleek exterior.  I don't find the "chute" of the pouring shield especially "easy" to add ingredients, especially when it's flour from a big mixing bowl.  The chute is not quite wide enough and flour tends to spill, so sometimes I don't use it, but this creates "splash-up" instead, so it's kind of a no-win situation.  The steel bowl is absolutely smooth and so there are no real ridges inside the bowl for anything to stick to.  The accessories twist off in a one-handed motion, are very secure and heavy, and are coated with a slick, non-stick, white finish - washing up is absolutely easy.
Counter Space: 
You cannot put this away, or you will never get it out again.  So for small apartment dwellers, you must think about your counterspace.  I am a pretty small female, and to me, is HEAVY, HEAVY, HEAVY.  While this is good because it doesn't wobble or "walk" across the countertop when it's mixing, this also makes it a gigantic pain to drag it out.  So anticipate that it will take up about 1 cubic foot of your countertop forever and that you should have it somewhere where you don't have to move it.
Mixing:
It is very, very thorough.  It has some weird "planetary mixing action," but whatever that means, it mixes mostly everything evenly.  Turn it off before you stick your spatula in.  It handles the stickiest focaccia dough to meringue perfectly, and the bowl "locks in" to the base, so you don't have to worry about it flying off.
Attachments:
These are super pricey in most cases, but the one that seems to draw the most raves is the pasta cutter (apprx. $100).  KA constantly has deals and sometimes has nice packaged deals on their website, so check there as well.  I have seen KA offer different accessories (including this one) for free on rebate, so watch for those.  KA also is constantly flogging "The Mixer Bible" by Meredith Deeds and on their website, they sometimes have an ask-and-answer with the author.  I do recommend getting a stand-mixer cover, or if you want to make one, there are several patterns available on the internet.  I'm lazy and cheap, so I use a big dishrag and that has worked so far.
Overall, I'm glad I made the purchase.  When I do use "the Fuselage" for baking jobs, it performs flawlessly and makes the baking much, much easier - you can get a good look at your dough consistency, etc. instead of worrying about if your frosting has unmixed chunks in it, or if your hand mixer is going to tip your entire bowl of pudding over while you run to get some missed ingredient.  By proxy, its ease of use turns you into a better cook in the end.  More relaxed, anyway, and if that's worth a couple hundred dollars to you, then by all means, buy it.

I purchased this drive from Amazon recently and tested it under both Mac OS X Tiger and Windows ME. In both cases, I saw excellent read speed but slow, slow write speed (1 MB/s to 1.4 MB/s, an order of magnitude lower than advertized). I was very disappointed at the poor performance to say the least.
Before returning the drive, I decided to test it under Windows XP. Wow, what a difference. The same drive, under Windows XP, is a speed demon. I am now satisfied that the drive behaves much more closely to it's advertized specs. For read speed, I am seeing something in the area of 30 MB/s, which is excellent. For write speed I am seeing roughly 7 MB/s. This is a little slower than advertized, but nonetheless, an excellent speed.
So, this is a great memory stick as long as you are using it under Windows XP (don't have Vista so can't comment, but I expect that performance under Vista would be similar). For earlier versions of Windows (9x and ME) though, be forewarned. Write performance is not good. Similarly, for Mac OS X Tiger be forewarned. BTW, for Mac OS X, I did try formatting the stick for HFS+ (the native Mac OS X format), but it made only a marginal difference.

This netbook is powerful enough for most functions. It works well running a virtual citrix server, so I can access my electronic medical records  and scans from my work.  It chokes when I access a multi-image CT scan on our imaging server, but can pull up a single x-ray without difficulty(pretty impressive for a netbook with only 1 gig of ram).  
I have it connected (tethered) through bluetooth to my Samsung Blackjack II cell phone internet connection, so I can access internet anywhere I get an Edge or 3G signal. It works great--total mobility.  
The keyboard is A+++. I am a right-shifter and the placement and size of the shift key is much better than my laptop. 
Did research and believe this is best netbook out there. The battery life is great. It can stream video through wi-fi(high power consumption) for around 6 hours. With average use, it is lasting me all day. No need to carry a battery pack.

It's a great rice maker - makes good rice without effort. My only cause not to give it 5 stars is that it takes a long time to make the rice - approximately 2-3 times longer than my old cheapo rice cooker. BUT the rice it does make is way better. I especially enjoy the timer function so I can wake up to freshly made rice or oatmeal in the morning. I would say that it is definately worth the money so far.

I have been snoring badly for years. My wife would kick me out of bed or she would go downstairs to sleep on the couch. I hated that. Neither of us got a good nights sleep. I was always tired. I have tried many devices and products that just don't work. The sloped pillow, the nose straps, sprays, ect. The next step was going to be more drastic. Then I saw an article in our local newspaper about devices you could get from your dentist. I researched these and thru that research found Anti-Snore. The name turned me off, but the price was right and the money-back guarantee was good so I ordered one. The fitting procedure was easy. My teeth were sore the first morning and for a few days, but that went away. I don't see the extra slavating that some say they get. It is weird to put something in my mouth each nite, but I got used to it. The BIG thing is that it actually works! It has been around 3 weeks now and my wife says my snorning is gone, except slightly when I'm on my back. We both get a good nights sleep and we sleep together. Thank you Anti-Snore! A product that works and for a good price.

This is exactly what I was looking for.  I read several of the reviews prior to purchasing and had some concerns  that the video may not be of very good quality and the drawbacks with the software that comes with it.  I used it for the first time out of the box.  I filmed in my office and then later that day at home.  It was just fine.  The picture quality and sound were as good as the tape models with the added bonus of no tape.  I have Windows Vista on my home computer and had no problem with the software provided (I am not very computer literate).  I also used Windows Movie Maker that was on my home computer.

I suppose there isn't much I can say about this switch that hasn't already been said, but I'm trying to improve my Amazon recommendations by reviewing items, so...This little switch is a beauty.  It just works.  This is one of those items that's invisible when it's working properly, and you really don't even notice it.  It's compact size ( despite the listed dimensions on Amazon ) makes it very portable for those impromptu LANs, and it just looks good.  You'd do well getting one.  There are frequently offers for this item, so try not to pay full price.  Also, the pictured item doesn't seem to match with the actual switch, so be certain which you're getting, I suppose.

This is a simple, compact toaster that has every single feature you'd want to make plain old perfect toast. The design is a throwback to solid engineering. As another reviewer mentioned, it's sturdy yet lightweight. It has a mechanism to hold any dimension of toast, bagel or waffle in place so both sides are evenly toasted. No overly complicated settings, just plain old perfect toast and bagels every time. So much happier with it than my old toaster oven! It also takes up limited counter space. If you're in the market for a new toaster, you'd be hard pressed to do better unless you need a 4 slot model. In that case, I'd probably go with the Haier model as well.

This adapter works perfectly for Apple IIe to Mac transfers and vice-versa using the A2V2 and ADT software included in the Virtual II Apple II emulator.  I was able to connect my old Apple IIe to my G4 PPC running OSX 10.4.11 using a Super Serial Card in the Apple IIe, a DB25 to DE9/R232 straight through cable from RetroFloppy.com, and this Keyspan DE9 to USB adapter.  The A2V2 and ADT apps included with the Virtual II emulator I'm using worked on the very first try after following the instructions in the A2V2 help file.  Don't go cheap on the DE9/R232 to USB adapter, this is the one that works.  The drivers are excellent and make this the no problem solution if you are in the small community I'm in.  (Also, DE9 = DB9 in case you were wondering about connector terminology). - I highly recommend this adapter.

I have two cats, one was a little scared at first, but the other one took right to it and will even lay beside it on occassion when it is hot.  Now they both love it, when I first set it up, it did make a sound, but after a week when I went to clean it, I realized that is makes that sound if it is not completely full.  Now the loud sound that others complain about is gone, you have to make sure that not just the reserve part of the fountain is full but also the main container level matches water level as well. Cleaning it once a week is best, since fur can get caught as well as food bits in the main fountain.  But it is a really good fountain, it was so good that I got one for my moms new kitten!

I love this little gadget. I'm an IT professional by trade and a gadget lover in my personal life. I have a few normal laptops as well as a beefy Windows Mobile smartphone. Nevertheless, something was still missing.
As a father of two children under four, it's often hard for me to spend dedicated time on my laptop, and bringing it out amongst the kids scares me. Expensive laptops are a bit bulky and easy to whack, if you catch my drift. What I needed was a device that allows me to do some basic web browsing, email, and writing while being small enough to handle easily around the kids. The Aspire One fits the bill.
Now, I'll tell you a couple of things. I was very skeptical that this machine would actually be useful and bought it on a whim thinking I could return it; it has been very useful indeed. I would also be the last one to recommend an Acer-branded anything. But in netbooks, Acer has transcended the rest of its product lines and produced a nice, respectable product. The design is sharp, on par with Dell and HP, and the quality appears passable for a device in this price range.
Overall, the Aspire One truly provides a portable computing experience unmatched by either a traditional laptop or a powerful smartphone. There have only been a few downsides, and they are as follows:
* The machine is certainly no speed demon. Loading complex web pages, such as those with heavy Flash, tends to be a bit sluggish. I addressed this partially by switching to Firefox instead of Internet Explorer (IE). I normally use IE, but it can be unbearably slow on the Aspire One. Firefox is much better, especially in scrolling with the trackpad.
* The fan is loud and annoying, and it seems to be on far too frequently. This is a common complaint about the model. I have the most updated BIOS as of 12/2008, which is suppose to address the matter, but it's still a problem for me. The noise is somewhat high pitched, I should note.
* I initially experienced some severe problems with the reliability of the wireless connection (802.11g). It was dropping out every minute or so, and I was almost ready to give up and return the unit. However, I connected to the Windows update website by Microsoft, and a newer driver was available for the wireless LAN device. This update appears to have solved my problems for the most part.
* The screen is sometimes just too small to carry out certain tasks pleasantly with. The horizontal resolution is great, but the vertical could use more. Even reading web pages can be somewhat laborious with all the scrolling, but this can be addressed partially by browsing in full-screen mode.
All in all, this product is a good value for the money and delivers as promised. Who would have thought Acer could do it?

This is the first fountain I'd bought, but our 17 year-old cat kept making a mess in the old water dish by pawing at the water with her front paws.  While this was cute, it made a mess. 
Got the fountain, she immediately abandoned the old water dish and now drinks much more water (good!) and doesn't splash in the water at all, just drinks right where the water flows out. 
She loves it so much - yelling and following me around the whole time I refill or clean it until it is back. 
The reservoir can be removed with water still in it without spilling water. 
Yeah, you might spill a little when putting it back, but it is okay with me.
It is pricey, but highly recommended if you really love your cat!

I first tried the Zymox without hydrocortisone.  That didn't really seem to clear up my dog's infection completely.  This product worked alot better.

I remember the days of the first &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBook"&gt;iBook&lt;/a&gt;. That thing was ugly. It was low powered and pretty much sucked. Those days are long gone. The New MacBook is Gorgeous and blazing fast. Some people won't like the changes but I love them. The improved graphics and overall design is fantastic. The glossy screen pops more than the previous model as long as you can avoid glare and the lack of firewire and other useless old ports won't be missed by me. Obviously the &lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/10/21/macbook-and-macbook-pro-review/2"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; is a better machine and has all the pro features you'd expect. Honestly on this model I'd love to see the DVD drive go away and have more hard drive space and have internet access through the iPhone. 
This will not be mistaken for a Dell. Maybe with all the money you save when you buy a Dell you can buy Windows 7 when it comes out, but probably not.

If you are looking for a personal grooming device you will find it in the bodygroom. The bodygroom offers good battery life, a comfortable design and best of all a close shave wet or dry.

This device comes with a disk that is supposed to help you go through the setup.  It refused to believe that the router was properly connected.  I did get a very nice person at Linksys that got me through the basic set up.  From there it all worked very well.
The speed of the N band is incredible.  I have a laptop setup for  N in the 5 gig band.  I've run some of the standard bandwidth tests (CNet most of the time).  The laptop tests at about 90% of the speed the desktop gets.  Sometimes better than 95%.  They are on different floors.
I was able to get the USB port to work,  I've seen clearer instructions but I muddled through.  
I would have given it 5 stars if the supplied program had worked.

It does work very well but international travelers need to know it is 120 VOLT 60 HERTZ only. 
I use it with a travel transformer, but because other countries use 50 Hz (transformers do not adjust frequency) it pulses slower than in the US, but it still gives satisfactory performance. The lower frequency will probably shorten the pump motors life, but because it works so well, I can live with that. The manufacturers website gave NO Information about the voltage and frequency for this unit and that is why I give only 4 stars.
My vendor was J&amp;R MUSIC AND COMPUTER WORLD and I give them my HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION for fast responsive service to APO and FPO addresses.
 I would have purchased directly from Amazon, but I live on a Forward Operating Camp in Iraq and Amazon does not ship most items to APO addresses.

My kitten and my dog love this waterer.  My former cat (deceased) played in it constantly.  This is my third one of these.  They seem to last about a little over a year and then you need a new one as your pets miss it dreadfully.  I also have the extras that can be purchased to provide additional water storage.

This is everything I want it to be. The problem is really user related. It is great that it works inside the pocket but it is so easy to forget to take the pedometer out of your pocket before we put our pants in the laundry. It sometimes takes a few washings without a problem but eventually, they fail. What does it mean when you put a battery inside a hot dryer? Nothing has happened so far but I wonder about it. I have replaced four pedometers so far. Otherwise, it's a great incentive and reliable so I continue to replace it.

The manufacturer recommends replacing the foil screen and cutter block every 18 months for maximum performance. I wholeheartedly agree. This cutting system seems to last a little longer than older models but it certainly doesn't last forever. While it might not be exactly at 18 months, you can readily tell that the blades are getting dull when it takes longer to shave and/or you begin experiencing skin irritation. The set is pretty expensive but Amazon.com seems to have a very competitive price (a lot cheaper than I've seen in any brick &amp; mortar store). Having said that, it really is like getting a brand new razor each time you make the change so it's very worthwhile doing it. Not sure if you can even buy them separately, but changing both parts at the same time ensures a closer shave with less skin irritation because they work together as an integrated system.

This is an attractive, compact, 500 gig external hard drive. A nice chrome sturdy and well built product. setup was simple and very very easy. It is a very quite drive in operation. It dose very well what a hard drive is expected to do. The drive was well packaged and arrived the exact day that it was estimated to be here, i had it up and running within 5 minutes. This is not the drives fault but the back up software simply sucks. It is difficult to set up and i could not get it to finish a back up without it erroring out. I ended up using nero's software for my back up's. 4 stars rating is because of the software.

We found this coffee maker really does work well, lives up to it's claims. The machine is easy to use, clean and program. It even tells you in the instructions that the #4 filters will be slightly large for the coffee basket-just pushing down on the filter bottom will make it fit the basket appropriately. The vacuum pitcher works incredibly well, really amazing how thermally efficient it is.
When our Bunn coffee maker went on the blink at work, I purchased a second Zojirushi for the office.

I own a Dell Dimension 4400 that I purchased new in 2002. It had Microsoft works 2002 6.  As of Jan. 09 I will be publishing a club newsletter. The prior publisher had purchased a "publishing" program for around $100.00.  I did not want to spend that much money and she suggested buying an updated works program as an alternative.  She had used Amazon.com before and guided me in my purchase.  My new software arrived in about 2 days, I uninstalled my 6. and installed my new 9.  My whole experience was very positive and the email notice of my credit for having used Amazon was a nice surprize.  Thank you.

My two year old daughter really enjoys this DVD.  She loves the music and images in it.  It is particularly nice that adults and children are shown doing the signs. 
I highly recommend this DVD and wish there were more!
As a side note, this company has excellent customer service!!

IT works really well,my cat's vet sent him home with a dose after his first check up and tried to sell us on buying it from their office in monthly supplies, i.e. 3mths,6mths. but it was too expensive there, like 30 bucks more than what Amazon has it. So I just order it from here now!

This is a nice, small size but large capacity flash drive that is easy to use and reliable.  I haven't had any problems with it and it seems to be compatible with all systems (I've tried it on Windows, Mac, and Linux).  For a 2 gig flash drive it is a very good value.

I bought this for my dorm room and it works very well. It has a good range for its type, though it seems to be slightly shorter than my friend's Netgear one (although this could just be because of room arrangements). Had one issue where it gave only local access, but the old unplug-replug trick worked and I haven't had any other problems. The size and shape are very convenient since it can sit in a small out-of-the-way place. It's also very easy to set up.

This show breaks many genre rules successfully through complex storylines, excellent writing and brilliant performances by cast and crew.  The special effects are movie quality.  The writing will appeal to fans of the West Wing, X-Files, and The Unit.  This box set is well worth the price.  You will not be disappointed.

I used this on a Cocker Spaniel, two chihuahuas and a cat.  The cat had the most dramatic results - it was like taking another animal off her and her coat looked fantastic.  The cocker didn't have quite the same dramatic effect, but she didn't shed much in the first place.  The two Chis shed like crazy and while I didn't pull off a whole pile of hair, I did notice a pretty significant reduction in shedding over the following week.  Also, my chi who hates being brushed, actually really enjoyed being brushed by the FURminator.  Overall a purchase worth the money.

Having used this item for several weeks, I can attest to it's excellent performance.  Although I am not sure why you need a turbo button, when it seems to me it should be on full vacuum all the time, it is an excellent beard and mustache trimmer/shaver.  Perhaps a little big, but not heavy.  Simple to use, and many hair length settings. I have no reservation in recommending this one.

Excellent HBO television mini-series version of the book John Adams. An intriguing and entertaining view of John Adams, showing all of his qualities, his brilliance, his stubborness, his vanity, his pride, his devotion to first the idea anf later the country of America. A must have for lovers of history.

I got this pedometer a few months ago and it works so well, that I just ordered another one for my brother's birthday present. I always use the safety strap in addition to the clip on holder, but have never had it slip out of the holder or the clip of the holder come undone. (This was a complaint of a previous reviewer, so I am cautious.)

This is at least my 3rd Waterpic and each lasts about 4-5 years before breaking.  I love using this device and if you really want a clean fresh mouth pour a little mouth wash in with the warm water and you will be happy.  My only complaint is a lack of real power.  I have my Waterpik set for the max and would like a little extra for power washing my teeth.

I don't know how I cooked without this!! Saves your arm from the hurt of either mixing by hand or holding up a hand mixer! I think if you buy one, you'll have it for life. Great durable quality- comes in beautiful colors too. I have the much coveted, long discontinued Violet. Looks fabulous in my kitchen! I didn't order this from Amazon, I got it from Kitchen Aid directly and I have to say I had nothing but problems with them. :( I would probably never buy another item from them directly, but would consider buying their products from another source, such as here. I have only had this for a short time, but I have made cake, homemade frosting and artichoke dip, which I couldn't be more greatful for my mixer.. saved me from hand mixing cream cheese! I can't wait to make more things! I also love that you can buy additional accessories to attatch. I am going to buy the grinder attatchment to make homemade baby food and grind my own meat. It is well worth the price for the quality and the durability you get.

This coffee maker is excellent.  It makes great tasting coffee quickly, and keeps it hot for hours.  I usually fire it up around 8:15A and it is still warm enough for an afternoon cup at 3:30P.  It will not overflow if the carafe is not seated precisely in the right position, as happened frequently with my last coffee maker.  The sneak-a-cup feature works fine, but usually drips one drop each time i use it.  Its only cumbersome feature is the cap on the carafe.  I find it difficult to grasp and turn.  May not be the best choice for someone with weak hands.  That being said, this coffee maker is a good value and I would recommend it to others.

This is a wonderful mixer.  A real workhorse.  KitchenAid seems to be one of the best companies in America.  The mixers are still made in America, when you call the customer service number you actually speak to a real person who resides in America and the company is not hesitant to go beyond anyone's expectations to keep the customer happy (the customer service of KitchenAid is amazing - the best I have seen).  Best of all, KitchenAid makes quality products to pass down from one generation to the next.  These mixers are made to last.  If you have a family, cook a lot, or simply enjoy baking, this mixer is for you.

I will skip the epsiode by episode reviews and just say this- 1. this is one of the deepest, most thought out, and compelling action\dramas ever put on TV. 2- Pretty much perfect casting and performances. 3- Winner of the Peabody award (for general excellence in television) which is not a sci-fi genre award, but one that has been given to the likes of 60 minutes, ER, and Hill Street Blues. If you have not seen this show do your self a favor and get this set, you will get your money's worth.

This products solves a painstaking problem in my house with 2 dogs.  None of them would take to nail clipping, so the task would get ignored.  
PediPaws is fantastic.  The instructions were written by someone who knows dogs and walks you through training them.  In one night my dogs were trained and they now line up to have their paws done (treats are readily available with each nail clip).

The router works flawlessly after a very challenging set up adventure.   The initial set up attempt was unsuccessful.  I use the Vista Home Premium operating system.  After 2 days of trying to configure the wireless set up using the Linksys provided configuration tool, I gave up.  Wired set up was not a problem.  After configuring the router for wireless operation with my laptop, the router recognized every wireless appliance on the network except for the laptop that I used to configure the router.  I gave up after 2 days of unsuccessful attempts.  Then I  switched to the Windows Vista wireless configuration tool, and I was up and running in less than 5 minutes.
