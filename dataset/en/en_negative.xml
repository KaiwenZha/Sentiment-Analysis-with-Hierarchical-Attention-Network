The collar hardly ever fires even when my dog is barking her head off. I installed a new battery, I positioned it on her according to the instructions, and still it doesn't work.  I intend to contact the manufacturer and request an exchange under warranty just to see if I got a defective unit.

As a fan of the first three books, particularly Eclipse, I truly anticipated Breaking Dawn. Now I wish that I had stopped with Eclipse and left Bella and Edward's future to my imagination.
While I don't think Breaking Dawn warrants 1 star, there are too many problems with the plot, consistency, characters and overall writing for me to justify awarding more than 2 stars. After reading the various Q&amp;A's Stephenie gave after Breaking Dawn's release, I can begrudgingly overcome some of these problems, but there are too many others, including a monumentally disappointing final "battle."
*Spoilers!*  
This is one long novel--not just in page count, but in terms of readers' patience, as well. Perhaps if it was split into two novels, the author could spend more time incorporating explanations for problematic plot twists--Renesme?--and strengthening character development rather than explaining herself endlessly after the book's publication. I didn't feel an overall arc to the plot--rather, this was like hitting key points in Bella's life (here's where she got married, where she first had sex, where she got pregnant, where she gave birth and was transformed, where she hunted, ad infinitum). There wasn't any thread throughout until partway through Book Three, when the !Volturi! threat began---and fizzled out.
The wedding was disappointing; I would have expected far more details given the level of anticipation for this event. There's no description of the wedding dress--but there was for Alice's outfit! Renee was a joke--flies in for the day of the wedding, with just enough time to help Bella put some combs in her hair, and that's it? Jasper, the vampire with the most difficulty with humans, picked her and Phil up from the airport? Rose did Bella's hair--with little explanation why she was suddenly nice? Or was this a ham-fisted attempt at foreshadowing their pregnancy partnership?
The Volturi were a great addition to the books--the "vampire police" were a fascinating concept and I enjoyed learning more about their backgrounds, operations, and the question of their true motivations where the Cullens/Renesme were concerned. However, the final confrontation was so drawn out it became boring. We learned more about them before the confrontation than we did during the confrontation itself. Finally, when it looked like the payoff would take place (Renesme and Jacob run-off; everyone declares their last words of love), Alice swoops in with another half-vamp and Aro says "my bad, nothing to see here, move on!" Everyone cheers and leaves, yet don't we suspect that the Volturi will somehow exact revenge on the witnesses? It's all very unresolved and unsatisfying.
Also problematic in Book Three is the sudden introduction of a plethora of new vampires and superpowers. While it's exciting to witness more interaction with the Denali clan, it's difficult to keep everyone straight (thus the index--maybe that should have been a sign!). Book Three is a dramatic departure from everything before: a new major character (Renesme) and tens of new minor characters; SuperVampBella who behaves opposite of human Bella; half the characters have some type of superpower they practice with each other; all the rules are changing (Bella's "private mind" can be breached by Renesme; newborns don't really need to be so bloodthirsty; werewolves are really shapeshifters; packs can break apart, reform, communicate, not communicate in whatever fashion is convenient for the plot; etc.), Charlie's okay with all the supernatural weirdness; there are several half-breeds alive, if you just know where to look; etc.
I expected Bella to change in obvious and less-obvious ways after becoming a vampire, but almost nothing of human Bella continued in SuperVampireBella. It's not enough that her clumsiness is gone now that everything physical is easy; Bella is extraordinarily beautiful, has what turns out to be the most helpful superpower in the confrontation by extending it out to everyone she wishes, can let Edward into her thoughts, has almost no insecurities anymore, can easily and smoothly charm a lawyer, and has perfect self-control from day one.
I know we're to buy that because Bella has mentally prepared to become a vegetarian vampire she can go without the typical newborn process, but she goes to Carlisle lengths, and Carlisle is to be extraordinary among vampires. She doesn't twitch or cry out in pain during her transformation, she stops mid-first hunt and runs away from human temptation--a feat Edward claims even mature vampires sometimes can't do, and can balance her "distractions" (i.e., need for blood, sex) from the very first day--a process that Edward, again, claims often takes years to achieve. Bella even learns to manipulate and extend her superpower in a very short amount of time. So easy for her--no true obstacles, she just rationally decides how she wants it to be, and makes it so. Not only is Bella unrelatable because she is no longer human, she's not even a particularly relatable vampire!
After all the build-up over concerns about moving to Alaska and avoiding people, bets on casualties, etc., Bella is "herself" and in perfect control of her bloodlust, plus the nifty bonus that she still wants Edward above all desires from the very moment he kisses her. No more mentions of Edward's concern about damned souls or lost humanity, no real mourning over losing face-to-face contact with Renee--after all, she has Charlie again! So, where's the drama? Oh, right, with the Volturi. And all they needed was a group of SuperFriends and a deuce ex-machina in the form of a South American vampire/human.
Charlie wasn't himself--since when does a chief of police not know how to get info from the CDC? Jake transforms in front of him (and isn't that a big no-no? some of the werewolves' parents don't even know!) and he takes it calmly--just don't tell him more than he needs to know! Again, he's the chief of police--yes, he's always overlooked many things he doesn't really want to think about, but doesn't he have some concern about public safety, what with huge wolves around?
And what about those "werewolves?" After the massive build-up and tension in Book Two over the pack split, a quick sentence or two from Bella reveals that suddenly everyone is happy again  because Jake imprinted on Renesme. All the discord in LaPush and among the werewolves and between Sam's pack and the Cullens is brushed away like it never really happened. So happy is everyone, in fact, that Sam and Jake can communicate telepathically, but only what they want, when they want. Convenient. Also, why the big reveal that they are actually "shapeshifters?" What purpose does that serve? It's random and unsettling, dropped in just at the end of the story.
The writing itself was subpar: vague, little variety in adjectives, poor grammar and spelling, stale dialogue. Bella doesn't stop to reflect on her experiences or behavior. Book Two sloshes through repetitive mush of how much physical pain Bella is in, how much psychological pain Jake and Edward are in, how dangerous the situation is, etc. Throughout Books Two and Three, conversations tend to drag on, particularly between the wolves, yet by the end, there's little discussion between Bella and Edward of their new reality as parents and how it has presumably changed their relationship.
Finally, as many have mentioned, there is the problem of the ending itself. I'm all for happy endings, but we've been told in these novels for so long that there will be consequences to Bella's choices. There's absolutely no realism left by Book Three, no satisfying payoff to the Volturi conflict, and then Bella ends up with everything she could possibly want, with no compromises, no consequences, and nothing negative for any of the Forks/LaPush crowd.
In the end, there were a few scenes that worked for me--Isle Esme, the birth, the transformation, the final scene with Bella and Edward---but not enough to rise above a meager 2-star review.

I purchased this router a little over a month ago.  Since using it, it has significantly slowed the pace at which I am able to surf the internet.  I called Linksys to try to solve tis and was on the phone with tech support for 90 minutes while he tried to solve the issue and even remotely controlled my computer to adjust the settings.  He said my router was bad and needed to be replaced.  He said to call customer service with my case number to have this done.  When I called back, there was no record of my call with the tech support and they asked me to call back in 30-90 minutes to give the computer time to upload the tech guy's notes.  I called back two hours later and was transferred between 10 different people only to find out that there still were no notes and thus they would have to start again to diagnose my problem.  This took an entire day and it is still unresolved.  Linksys should be ashamed of their customer service.  It is terrible.

I've now bought two of these Waterpiks, and each one broke within a month. The nozzle assembly seems of very poor quality. In both cases, as I was using the waterpik, the nozzle simply came apart. I can't believe that more people haven't had this problem, but in any case, I am now looking for a better quality product. I would not recommend this to anyone.

I bought this DVD thinking that it would be tailored for very overweight people since it is a "Biggest Loser" workout, but I could hardly do any of it. And worse was that he did the same poses OVER AND OVER AND OVER! So I kept thinking I might be able to do the next pose and then he'd do the same thing again...boring! So I didnt even get a workout cause I could hardly do it. Ive also heard bad things about the other Biggest Loser workouts so I wont be investing in them anymore...Tae-bo is still the best!!!

I bought this product two weeks ago from a major retailer.  I was admittedly dazzled by the huge harddrive space, and my intention was to rip my entire CD collection to high quality MP3 format and save everything to this device.  I have no interest in buying music and videos directly from Zune's store or trading files via WiFi.  I had already converted much of my CD collection to MP3 in Windows Media Player in preparation of bringing home my Zune.
My first disappointment with the Zune 120 gb was that I couldn't do a single thing with it until I installed its accompanying software to my computer.  This is not a 'plug and play' appliance.  One feature I that really like about my Sansa Fuze is that it automatically synchs with Windows Media Player, a program that is already on my computer.  After I installed the Zune software I discovered that it required an additional update to be downloaded and installed.
In general I don't like the Zune software.  It tries to take over as the default media software on your computer; it tries to gather information about you to send back to Zune; the interface is awkwardly designed and lacks explanation; the program is full of bugs.  The Zune software immediately found every music and video file on my computer and added it to its library, sometimes multiple times, whether I wanted them there or not.  Furthermore, I couldn't delete unwanted items from the Zune manager's library.  Uninstalling and reinstalling didn't clear these unwanted items, and I never did figure out where the software stores this information.
I installed all the MP3s I had ripped with Media Player to the Zune device and continued ripping CDs with Zune's software.  The Zune's ripping program was noticeably slower.  The only reason I even chose to rip with the Zune software at all was because it kept popping up everytime I inserted a CD, and closing Zune's program and opening Media Player each time simply became a hassle.
When I decided to sit back and enjoy the music I had loaded on my Zune, I was able to play several songs I had ripped with Media Player without any problem.  Then I selected a song I had ripped with the Zune software.  The Zune immediately went dead without any warning.  I couldn't turn the device back on, and plugging the USB cord into it didn't revive it.  I tried letting it charge for several hours but the Zune remained inert.  I took it back to store the next day.  The customer service representative told me that another Zune 120 gb had just came back with the same problem I had experienced.  I accepted a full refund and didn't look back.

This review is from: Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series [Blu-ray] (Blu-ray)
      
The HD-DVD and Blu-ray versions lack the "110 minutes of 'behind the scene' footege" + a documentary entitled "Planet Earth -- The Future". Full descriptions of these from amazon's websites are as follows:
"DVD Features:
110 minutes of behind the scenes footage - one 10-minute behind the scenes program for each episode (SD release only)
Documentary:Planet Earth - The Future: This 3-part, 2 1/2 hour series looks at what the future may hold for endangered animals, habitats and -- ultimately -- ourselves. Following the environmental issues raised by Planet Earth, it asks why so many species are threatened and how they can be protected in future. (SD release only)"
My friend bought the DVD set as a gift, and we started to watch this extraordinarily exceptional documentary series. Among all other things, the part that we most liked was those "behind the scene footages" because there are some utterly and literally unbelievable scenes captured that make you wonder how they were captured, and after each episode these footages tell you about the techniques used for videotaping. As a frequent documentary watcher, I was really puzzled with how these series were videotaped, and the footages shed light to many things.
Since I liked this series very much, I went to BestBuy and quarelled with a sales associate for the exhange of this DVD set with the Blu-ray one. Eventually I win, but when I came to my apartment, ultimately she won, because the footages were missing in the Blu-ray edition!!!
BBC, first and foremost, what made you think that Blu-ray player owners do not require or less require the bonus feautres??
Second, if you ever had to consider whether DVD player owners or Blu-ray player owners less need the bonus feautres, then how come you voted against the latter?? After all the bonus feautres constantly praise how you videotaped in HD!!
As to the narrators, I have not watched the series on TV, nevertheless I share the same opinion with others, as a non-American.
Why are you compelling these guys to watch the series in British English. I could respec`t your decision if you had sticked to British English for the TV broadcasting. But broadcasting with a U.S. narrator and then releasing the DVD with a Brit narrator is simply deceiving people.
Anyhow, for the prospective buyers I will, irrespective of the HD quality, recommend the DVD set instead of Blu-ray. Believe me, the DVD series was also very nice. Not to mention that another reviewer comments that the visual quality on this Blu-ray is far worse than the then TV broadcasting. He relies his facts on the encoding. I don't know whether he is true or not, but it is better to consider his comments as well.

The player works pretty much as advertised, but the lack of documentation in the package was staggering.
Such instructions as there are assume that you are ripping CDs into a Windows Media library - and then synchronizing the Sansa device from that program (2 weeks ago I would not even have understood the previous sentence).
My musical relationship is with RHAPSODY - and so getting the M250 to work with that web site was pretty much a matter of trial and error.
But - 4 days from the time that the M250 arrived on my doorstep - I had my music loaded.
You pay more for the NANO - but loading music from iTunes has to be easier than my experience.
My last concern focuses on the number of songs which the product packaging says this device will hold. Using WMA compression, Sansa claims up to 960 songs.
I guess that's 960 songs, with each song lasting about a minute. Loading normal, progressive-rock-type material I am carrying a little over 300 tunes.

I loved the 3 twilight books... believed everything fantastical about the story- until they brought Nessie the abomination in. This is not a book to tie the loose ends. This is a book about Nessie.
The point of the Twilight Series was about Bella and Edward's love story. Bringing in a BABY should not even be part of the equation. WHAT WAS MS. MEYER THINKING?!?!?!?!
The only redeeming parts of this book was the wedding and part of the honeymoon. I also enjoyed the part where Bella is discovering her new abilities. Other than that, its a messy story,and with too many small things happening. I was disappointed that Bella and Edward did not destroy their house after nights of passion (I thought their love was epic.)
Stephenie tried to make the readers love Nessie- but like I said. How can anyone fall in love with Nessie the Abomination???? AND how could Stephenie bear to have Jake imprint on her?!?!?!
The magic is gone.

My husband and I paid a breathtaking $100 for this coffee maker when they were fairly new on the market. Once every 6 months it would plug up and spew water all over the counter when it was supposed to be brewing coffee in the morning. Cleaning it was a nightmare (take it, turn it upside down over the sink and irrigate it until some tiny coffee ground dislodged from it's guts). My husband and I spent hours getting the coffee pot to work again. 
The entire thing is due to some really stupid engineering. You don't fix it up so that the ground regularly plug up the water reservior. 
This morning was the last straw. I took it outside and threw it against the concrete walkway behind my house and watched gleefully as the wretched thing exploded into plastic and bent aluminum pieces. I can truly say that was the most satisfaction that object ever delivered to me.
I am going out today and buying a decent brand of coffee maker and never ever wasting my money on Cuisinart again. 
By the way, my Cuisinart food processor broke recently because the safety catch on the top lid came off right at the spot I predicted it would break. I knew that there would be too much stress on a thin and small part...guess what, I was right. 
So, from my experience, Cuisinart is just an expensive name. Go out and get a Hamilton Beach food processor or a Kitchen Aid coffee maker.

I typically don't write reviews, especially the low-score one, but I felt I have the obligation to tell this to everyone.
It's a nightmare, my 2-month old MacBook pro dead. I used to have IBM thnkpad T-series notebook (now Lenovo) and it was great compare to this Mac in terms of reliability. I can carry the IBM thinkpad to work in the morning and bring it back to home in the evening without power down for SEVERAL weeks, there was no issue at all. I thought I was little rough to the thinkpad so I power down this Mac everyday after the work, carefully carry it around, well, when it happens, it happens, all the sudden, it dies. I'm in the process to recover the data, I'm mad. I'll update the review later for the service experience, so far not very good either.
Another issus is you can't fold down the screen compeletedly outwards, it will break it. Bad design, image accidentaly you push down the screen for better view angle and you could break it and that's not covered by warranties. 
Regardless how great the MacBook is, it's a great pain when your working computer dies, you need get it repaired, resintall the application, recover the data if possible, and re-do all your work if data is lost, what about the photos you took for the special moment yesterday that haven't upload yet... too bad.
No, I don't want anything fancy, I just need a reliable PC to do my things (paper, dissertation, spreadsheet, make movies), which all PCs on the market can do.

After spending over 3 hours trying to download the installer software, then downloading MS updates and installing them per Amazon's help desk instuctions, I still couldn't download the Turbotax software I purchased.  If you want to take a chance on spending hours trying to download it, go ahead and purchase this software from Amazon.  If not, spend $20 more, pick it up at Walmart, and use the 2.5 hours remaining to actually do your taxes.

I have had the WRT310N for several months now.  I am already on my 2nd unit having replaced the original one under warranty within 6 weeks.  The problems with both are the same.
At random intervals, the router's web configuration is inaccessible to any device on the network.  The router will respond to a ping request for a period of time.  Eventually pinging to the router fails.  When that happens, Only those systems that have static IP's can communicate with one another.  Anything with a dynamic IP, either wired or wireless is unable to communicate with any other device.  
As I stated above, I am currently using a warranty replacement which is exhibiting the same problems as the unit I purchased originally.  Linksys tech support is essentially a joke but I've known that a long time.  Their "analysts" do nothing more than read scripts that guide you through steps I've done several times before calling them.  I am sure they can help someone who is much less technically inclined but the only thing they can do is provide me with a warranty replacement.
After reading some posts here and in the Linksys message boards, I see I am not alone with this problem.  Upgrading the firmware was of no help either.  I might not mind it as much if the router was not in a room in my basement where I rarely spend time.  Sadly it looks as though I will have to invest in another device unless Linksys can find a cause and a solution first, the prospects for which I have very little hope.

I purchased this "waterproof collar" to assist in training my dog.  He learned quickly that the tone was immediately followed by a shock if whatever behavior he was exhibiting did not stop.  Sadly, I have a dog that enjoys the sprinkler system....and I found out that the collar was not waterproof.  I now found myself out $130.00 for a training collar that only lived about two months.
I contacted PetSafe and braced myself for a fight while attempting to get them to honor their "Lifetime Warrantee," but was pleasantly surprised that they were both responsive and courteous.  The support employee on the phone immediately stated that he was not comfortable with trying to repair a unit that had been wet on the interior, and he immediately shipped a new unit with a return postage label for the broken unit.
While I do not think this product is everything it could be, the warrantee and the support from PetSafe motivated me to change my initial rating from 2 stars to four.

From day one, back in late August 2006, I've had problems with this router--which I bought only because my ISP wouldn't install an extra cable outlet in my apartment without written permission from my new landlord. Since I work from home, this wasn't an option at the time. I'm not a tech guy, I don't care much for gadgets, but I'm not stupid either, and I couldn't even get this thing set up without calling support due to lack of documentation and the assumption that everyone buying this router uses some version of Windows--I don't, I have an iMac. Once set up, the router worked fine for about a month, and then I started experiencing connectivity issues. I called support again and they figured out some issue with 'mac cloning' or some such, reset my static IP, and all was well for another week, when the same issue--losing connection with the router after 10-20 minutes online--arose again. So I called support AGAIN, got a guy after 7 minutes, but he directed me to their website to download a firmware update, and then basically hung up on me. Unacceptable. So I called back, sat on hold for 40+ minutes before being disconnected without ever speaking to anyone. Finally, after a third try, I got someone on the line and he got me to the firmware and helped me install it via their web interface, only for me to experience the same connectivity problem the very next day. My ISP is coming Tuesday to install another outlet. No documentation. The install CD is configured for Windows and wouldn't work in Mac OS X. Online help sucks. The 800 support line sucks. This product sucks. Do not buy it.

First and formost, I am an avid reader of most things.  I was introduced begrudgingly to this series through a friend and the upcoming movie.  Upon beginning Twilight, I was sucked in rather hard.  New Moon though, I found to be a different kind of book.  Please understand, this review is personal, and I understand that many may not have recieved the pain I did upon reading it. 
The book itself is well done; the dialogue is consistent, there are fewer errors in the book (minus the name change of a minor character), there's a bit more action and less personal reflection on the perfection of Edward.  The role of Jacob is necessary, and well written.  He fulfills all the parts required of him.  However, the conclusion of the book is what causes me pain.  For those who have felt the loss and betrayal of a lover-particularly one you see yourself with permanently, the damage Edward does to Bella is truly unforgivable.  Her willingness to forgive and forget is unrealistic.  Of course, as a fictional character, she is allowed to respond however she wants.  And of course, as Meyer designed, she places everyone's need above her own.  I must hand it to Meyer though, the description of Bella's pain is exceptionally accurate.  The most upsetting part of the book is also the simplest: only one word was needed per page.
I am worried though, that the young female readers will recieve a heightened damsel complex, expecting their mate to respond to them without vocalization, and that this kind of betrayal (despite Edward's intentions) is acceptable.  The type of pain Bella goes through for him is too realistic for me to accept the unrealistic conclusion.  I look forward though, to continuing the saga to its conclusion.

I started having problems backing up my work. I called the support number and got somebody in another country. She must have been reading from a script because she paid little attention to what I was trying to tell her. She spent almost 10 minutes trying to get me to pay for what was supposed to be free help. Finally, I got a supervisor on the line whose English did not have such a strong accent. In just a few minutes, he explained what the other tech was trying to get me to do to resolve the issue I was having in backing up my work. No help. Just renaming the program index is not a solution.

I eagerly anticipated this book along with thousands of others... but in the  end it did not live up to my expectations.  Basically books 1-3 were wonderful and believable even though the subject matter was so supernatural, the characters connected and the plot line was interesting... this book was of a totally different feeling.  It was almost 100% focused on the supernatural which made it feel unbelievable. And the plot line was outrageously ridiculous but at the same time boring.
1. It felt like the characters were suddenly empty... without the same amount of depth as in the other three books.
2. Events were too "convenient"
3. It felt like rising action, rising action, rising action - then NO CLIMAX.  Like a blockbuster kung-fu movie without the big final fight at the end. Not that I really wanted people to die, but come on!! It could have been amazing if they actually  fought and defeated the Volturi etc.
Maybe I'll have to make up my own ending...

It's a cool looking quiet drive + it is priced reasonably. Also, while it was working with our Direct TV HD receiver, I was a happy customer. Then, after just 1 month, it died taking all our recorded shows &amp; movies to the zone of "no return". The lights are still on, they even go from red to violet and then blue - yes, very entertaining and pretty ;), but the drive is unrecognizable. I bought a new eSATA cable, I rebooted my HD receiver numerous times, (not suspecting that a drive can possibly fail just after 1 month), I tested it on 2 different computers w XP OS &amp; Vista + I used 2 different types of connections: USB and eSATA, but both computers failed to see the drive.
 
The worst part about this experience, (besides wasting money, energy &amp; time) is non-existent AcomData's customer support.
Try calling (909) 786-4280. You have to press 1 for a technical support. Then every minute you will be prompted to press 1 again in order to continue to wait for the next agent, otherwise they automatically redirect you to their mailbox. You can't even turn on a speakerphone and do something else while waiting for somebody to show any signs of life at that company, because they want you to act as a monkey by pressing 1 as soon as you hear that their agents are busy helping other customers. Also, 2 times, after I had presses 1 ~ 5-6 times, while waiting for that mysterious customer support, I got disconnected. How more obvious can they be with this system? They could have put *do not disturb* banner on their web page &amp; prerecorded a message, which would say: *we will try to make it very difficult for you to reach us, so hang up right now &amp; thank you for understanding*. Email this company &amp; see how long it will take them to respond, especially if you're requesting RMA number. 
Very poor customer support, so you're taking a huge risk by buying any drives from them... If your drive breaks, it will take too much time &amp; energy to get a replacement. I still haven't heard back from them &amp; something tells me that it will take forever to receive a working product from them.
I would wait before buying anything else from this CA based company. I will stand by my 1-star review for now. I understand that sometimes things break, but when your product is under a warranty, I expect to have it replaced in a prompt manner. 
If you decide to go forward with this purchase anyway, please back up everything you will be storing on this device.

I bought this thinking I was going to be brushing out my cat's coat. Instead, this TRIMMED my cat's coat. It cut the hair, it did NOT brush the hair. It left her looking raggedy instead of smooth and glossy. Help with shedding? Yeah, if you don't mind the fact that it just completely removes the hair. I used it once, hated the results, and took it back for a refund.

Like other reviewers here we had this kettle around 12 months only before it died.  On average we probably used it 2-3 times a day to boil water for hot tea and a coffee press.  We weren't unhappy with it while it worked but one day it just died - seems like some kind of electrical issue as the power socket it was plugged into showed signs of overheating (browning, slight melt etc.).  If it only lasts a year that's very poor - there are much better options I believe - we replaced it with a T-Fal and so far have been very happy with that (plus it seems to boil faster than the Chef's Choice).

Bought this "piece of mind" on Amazon. 
There were no problems with installation on Vista, but what a faulty product in general. The most important point, it doesn't do what it's supposed to do - a voice recognition. 
It's a toy for 5 minutes, but after that you realize that you ended up with extremely lousy software - slow, inaccurate, buggy, and annoying.  
To summarize it in one word - useless!

Bought this as a Christmas gift for myself off Amazon last December.  Used it a few times, and then had to stop--the shift from shaving to epilating created a GIGANTIC ingrown hair (!) problem.
It's been over a year since I bought the machine, and about 8 months since I stopped using it.  I still have healing areas on my legs which are red and angry, and severe scarring--lots of discolored white areas that I'm worried won't return to skin color.
I don't know if I have extra sensitive skin or something (would be news to me) but SERIOUSLY consider if the risk is worth it before buying this!  I was excited to save money/hassle, but now I'm embarrassed to wear shorts.  I regret using this.

Anyone who enjoyed the first book but found the phrasing repetitive and the character of Bella to be mildly annoying, be warned.  
Pgs 1-70 are actually interesting, aside from Bella being a brat about turning 18
Pgs 70-400 are basically the plot of the first book, recycled, with Jacob as the new love interest.  As with Edward, she shuns the other kids at school, wants to spend all her time with him, and, when she finds out what he really is, she embraces it, meets the family...etc etc.
pgs 400-the end are essentially the only novelty to the book.  Even so, it's ruined by the fact that Bella is so helpless and insecure.  I don't understand why Edward loves you either, Bella, but he does.  And I don't want to have to read 500 pages of him convincing you of that.
This book is basically ACT II of the first book, but with a few less obnoxious descriptions of Edward's bronze hair/marble body/topaz eyes, and a few more obnoxious descriptions of the aching hole/depression in Bella's soul when Edward leaves her.
Bella morphs from being slightly annoying and whiny, to being completely pathetic.  Her world revolves around Edward, so when he leaves, she is left in a catatonic state...until eventually she decides to rebel and do crazy things, in the hopes that she might hear his voice (oh yes, that velvet voice of his is in this book too, and velvet must be on Meyer's 'favorite adjectives list").  
But then Bella finds reason for living again, in the arms of another man, Jacob.  Her basic attraction to him is based on...wait for it..."she's less miserable with him".  Hmmm....the co-dependent latches on again.  She completely leads him on, because the whole time she is with him, she is still thinking about Edward and how she can reunite her crazy messed up head with a precious delusion of him.  
In the end, Edward and Jacob are mortal enemies (oh no!) and Bella is left choosing between the man who is the world to her, and the man who is the world to her when the man who really is the world to her is unavailable.  Gee, I wonder who she'll choose in the end.  Apparently Meyer wants us to think it's a toss up and plans to make another book of it.  Yeah right.
I can only hope that the third book doesn't contain the following phrases and/or words, because I HATE THEM BY NOW:
grimaced
smirked
topaz
velvet voice
touseled bronze hair
marble slab
perfect face
singing laughter
aching hole
russett skin

I bought this item expecting to be blown away.  I wasn't. I needed to update the OS to 2.2 and was actually charged $10 by Apple.  I called Apple tech support to confirm and the tech first said "no way we would do that" then confirmed that in fact Apple had gone done that path.  Then their servers are so busy that after paying the $10 I couldn't update the OS..still can't.  The only saving grace I had is that I was considering the iPhone.

I bought the Petmat Fresh Flow on sale at my local pet store for only $19.99. At such a low price, I thought it was a good deal, and both of my cats love to drink from the faucet. They'll meow for hours on end for us to turn on the water. The first six months we had this fountain, it worked wonderfully. The cats loved it, it filtered well, and it ran quietly. The water did need to be refilled frequently, as I don't think 50 oz is sufficient, but overall, it worked well.
Then, after six months or so, it started to become very loud. The sound could only be ameliorated by filling the fountain REALLY full - within millimeters of the brim, and even then, it would take 30 minutes to fully quiet/settle down. It also started to collect a lot of dust and general dirt. I would attempt to wash it, but it never seemed to get clean. Eventually, we just got rid of it - the noise was getting too troublesome.
Recently, I've purchased a Drinkwell Platinum Fountain (with 168 oz capacity), and I hope that it will be more durable than the Petmate was.

This review is from: Gone with the Wind (Two-Disc Edition) (DVD)
      
I thoroughly enjoyed Gone with the Wind as entertainment and spectacle.  The epic romance, even if it is about two rather shallow people (but what hilariously shallow people!).  The lavish sets and sweep of the story are both to be commended.  I can see why this movie is so remembered.
However, I am not African American, and I try to imagine what it would be like to see it through their eyes.  The movie glorifies the slave-holding South ("the land of plenty and grace"!), and every black person--except the uppity black carpetbagger--is docile, happy-go-lucky, and stupid.  Yes, stupid.  The movie shares its era's perception that blacks aren't genetically up there with the white folks and runs with this idea for all it's worth.  Crissy, especially, is the personification of every racist stereotype imaginable:  brain-dead, cowardly, hysterical, likes to sing, etc.  Incredibly, the movie even thinks giving black Americans the right to vote is a mistake since they are easily misled by Yankees--as shown in that "You'll vote for your friends" scene.  And, of course, the Klan is glorified as a means of taking back Southern pride from uppity blacks and Yankees as shown by Ashley and Scarlett's second husband going after the people in the "shanty town."  And truly, do we really need to worry about the spoiled desires of two white people when millions of blacks were suffering through the worst humiliation and pain in the history of this country?  Excusing the blatant racism in this movie as "it's a product of its time" will only get you so far.
So, yes, this is a good movie--but you might as well make an epic romance about the marital problems of two spoiled German Protestants during, say, the Holocaust.  And only because the people suffering here are black and not white can this movie get away with it.

This book and its ethos are ridiculous.  "At Krispy Kreme, all you need to do is order the Very Berry Chiller instead of the Mocha Dream Chiller, and you'll save 500 calories! (Do that once a week and you'll drop more than 7 pounds this year-without trying!)"  The only time you should really be consuming either one of them is if someone put a gun to your head and forced you to choose one or the other.  
Am I really reading that you should substitute a Big Mac for a Whopper to "drop pounds?"  This book should be insulting to you.

I really should have paid closer attention to the negative feedback that this product was given.  I purchased these sheets for $60 because they were featured on Amazon's "Today's Deals" and I thought I was getting a steal of a deal.  What I actually got was basically a one-use disposable sheet set.  They fit loose on the bed before washing them, they shrink in the wash, but do so to the point that they rip when you put them back on the bed.  This I attribute to weak stitching at the seams.  The smooth finish that they initally have coming out of the package is lost on the first wash also, and a woman's mascara is all that it takes to permanently stain them.  I don't really care if my sheets wrinkle coming out of the dryer, which they did, but I do expect them to hold up to normal use.  I am very surprised that a product of such poor quality is listed on such a good online shopping site.

Just like another reviewer, I had a difficult time removing the sticker on the front door of the microwave.  By the time I had very carefully rubbed off the adhesive, there were 4 prominent scratch/scuff marks on my new microwave.  Sharp customer service was very uncooperative and unresponsive in helping me resolve the issue of a new microwave with blemishes because of the adhesive they used on a sticker which didn't need to be there in the first place.  They directed me to the nearest authorized service center where they said I would have to pick up the tab if I wanted a new door.  I chose this microwave for 2 reasons, it's small size fit in my cabinet space and it looked clean and modern.  Well now it looks cheap and ugly.  Let's face it, a microwave is a microwave, it heats up your leftovers, boils water, and pops your popcorn.  What you're left with is an appliance that fits your style or decor and a company that will back up their product should problems arise.  In my opinion, Sharp is not a company that backs up their products or cares about its customers--I will NEVER buy another Sharp product again!

I earlier warned buyers about Intuit's new, hidden $10-per-printed-return fee, and asked Amazon.com to correct the listing so it was not hidden. Since then, Intuit has dropped this outrageous additional fee, but in the meantime I bought the cheaper rival Taxcut instead. Although it's not quite as easy to use as TurboTax (for example, you can't have it total multiple items in an entry to get a total, such as for expenses in Schedule C), it's easy enough to use. It won't take TurboTax users long to get into the Taxcut swing of things.
I used to willingly pay extra for TurboTax's slighty better user interface, but Intuit's greedy play to essentially double its software's cost -- just four years after it tried something similar with its poor "antipiracy" limited-number-of-returns technology -- offends me deeply. It's clear the company will try yet again in a future version, regardless of customer feedback. So, I'm no longer a customer. Fool me once, ...

I think worryingly my comments have been expressed repeatedly and the problems I have experienced seem to be shared by others.
I have thick dark stubble and the following is what I found.
The problems so far are that I just don't get a clean shave. There is no way I can arrive at work with patchy stubble like this. I know many say 3 weeks but what should I do in those 3 weeks? I don't have time to practice which is the reason I got this but I guess I'll keep trying. I just had to resort to a wet shave this morning though.
The shaver gets hot, doesn't clean shave, despite going over the same area several times (very difficult on chin and neck) and stretching the skin in all directions, and actually starts to irritate by the end of the shave. Very worryingly, its been catching on slightly more prominent stubble! Ouch....
On the plus side, the parts that do shave well are very clean (just below the sideburns), the unit looks great, it has excellent grip, and the cleaning feature is wonderful.
At this early stage, I'm very worried and would give it an early 1 star if it wasn't for its looks. I didn't buy it for that though so a return may be in order.
It appears to me from roughly combining the reviews so far, if you're used to electric shavers, this is a good product but if you're used to wet shaves, this might never match expectations, such is the quality of a decent wet shave.
I will update my review in due course.

This review is from: The Dark Knight (Two-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy) (DVD)
      
Heath Ledger is dead, and this is the role that, more or less, lead to his death. He showed promise with Brokeback Mountain and in The Dark Knight he cements the fact that he was more than just that guy from that teen movie that was based on a work by Shakespeare, but it won't happen.
Oddly enough, this isn't the only saddening part about the film; pretty much every aspect is, other than Ledger's pitch perfect performance. It needs to be said: Christian Bale cannot act; ok he did a marvelous job in The Prestige, but that's a one time deal apparently. He's a horrid batman, not as bad as Clooney, but he's still unwatchable. Batman's supposed to have a gruff voice, I know this, but it's not supposed to sound like he's belching his lines, it's that simple.
For a film that's over 2 hours long it sure promised a lot, built up a great deal of expectations and then just completely fizzled by the end of it.
I'm sick of Morgan Freeman always, ALWAYS, playing the same role; the old wise man with an insightful perspective and reserved manner; does the man have no range? Please, someone give me a pointer to a film where he doesn't do the same old. Maggie Gyllenhall was absolutely awful as well, my lord, the bad performances are everywhere, so much so that they basically could have just edited it to the point where it's all Ledger's show and nothing else.
The directing was nothing special, the story wasn't anything they couldn't have fit into a 23 minute episode of the cartoon, and the attempt to resonate a deep philosophical perspective is marred by the fact that it's just not well written or acted or directed. For an action film it certainly was incredibly tedious and unbearably slow.
Nobody better try to feed me anything about this being a character study, or a comic book movie for adults; because it's not, you're fooling yourself if this is your frame of mind. It's a popcorn movie, a summer cash in, and nothing more; well, there's the cornerstone of nihilism that is The Joker, but other than that you're better off watching Killer Klowns from Outer Space.

Even after several adjustments and trimming the collar down significantly, this anti-bark dog collar was also an "anti-working" dog collar for our small shi-tzu/poodle mix.

I was very excited about the possibilities of this little camera. It's small enough to carry anywhere and with the ability to download video to my computer and upload it to the world, it opened up a whole new channel of communication.
Sadly, the results were far short of my expectations. On two different media-friendly Macs, the software simply wouldn't download video and make them available for edit. The process aborted at different stages at each attempt, sometimes in the download, sometimes when the videos were on the screen and I attempted to edit  them.   I guess you won't be seeing my video snippets on You Tube any time soon. 
I'm also sorry to see that this report of my experience has proved 'unhelpful' to some shoppers. I wonder what it is about my saying that I couldn't make it work that distresses them.

Kudos to RDJ for taking a gamble (could've easily gone sour &amp; branded him a racist, sending him to rehab for racism).  Innovative start w/ satirical fake previews (albeit, I'd seen that in the Family Guy 'movie').  Good surprise casting with the studio exec (but the makeup job was the only really funny part).
In all, mildly entertaining.  I just bottomed the rating because it fell way short of the hype machine.

I cannot explain enough how horrible my experiences were with Seagate.  I originally bought this product to back up all of my memories- photographs, music, and documents- since my ancient computer was pitter pattering on it's way out and has a very small hard-drive. 
I had a 320 GB FreeAgent hard-drive and after about 8 months, one day it just stopped working.  I googled the issue to find out it is really common for Seagate products.  After calling Seagate technical support I found out that a company of theirs was my only option at getting my memories back (for a minimum of $1,000 and up to $3,000 in data recovery).  Seagate declares the warranty invalid if you get data recovery through any other company or service (which would be cheaper, but still extremely expensive).  
What I decided to do in an act of desperation was physically take apart the casing and remove the hard-drive since I'm computer savvy and try to power it with a Caddy-drive.  Upon disassembling the Seagate product I saw that the power converter was singed and had fried my hard-drive, making it impossible to get any files back without going through an expensive service.  This could have been prevented had Seagate designed better ventilation/fan system for the amount of heat this drive produces.  Today, I got a quote from Best Buy- it would cost $1599 for data recovery through them.
Best Buy told me flat out that this problem was 100% due to a poorly produced product and Seagate refuses to be helpful in the least.  Point being, Seagate hard-drives are poorly designed and they try to trap you into giving them money for data recovery once your drive fails.  All of their drives have the same problem, where they overheat and destroy the hard-drive.  The only reason most reviews have been good is because, like I did in the past, most reviewees have rated the hardware before it overheats.

I have had a pair of jersey t-shirt sheets for well over 10 years.  They have held up well, but have a few stains and a couple little holes.  They are a little bit thin on the part where I lay, but I consider them thick in comparison to these Pike Street ones.  I was hoping to replace my sheets, but instead, I am keeping them as they are far superior to the Pike Street sheets.
These Pike street sheets are atrocious to try to fit on the bed.  Yes, they fit, but are not all that deep.  But, the biggest problem is getting them on.  They grip, they are not soft smooth and glidey (if you will) like my other t-shirt sheets.  You cannot manuever them easily.  It took me at least 15 minutes or more to get them on right.  They have no give.  My other ones just go right on and are smooth enough to maneuver around, and the Pike Street, their surface is too rough and it is a huge struggle.
The quality of these Pike Street sheets are awful!  After one wash, they have all kinds of pilling.  I thought only polyester pilled.  They are very thin.  I have the natural color and you can see your hand very well through them!  I can't imagine these sheets lasting even half as long as my others.  I would love to get another set of the others, but they are Charter Club and I cannot find them any longer, don't think they make jersey sheets anymore.  What a shame.  They do still make sheets, though, and I may buy the flannel ones later: CHARTER CLUB King Flannel Sheet Set with Penguins &amp; Snowflakes, PG15SS787. 
I chose to buy these Pike Street sheets because it was a good price and all the other reviews I read for other brands said theirs were too small.  Big Mistake.  I don't know if all jersey sheets are made horribly like this, but I don't think I will order anymore jersey sheets by mail again.  I need to be able to look at them and touch them before buying.  These sheets are not soft and smooth and after one use, they look like I have had them 20 years.  Buy them only if you do not mind poor quality and don't mind fighting to get them on your bed correctly.

I have bought TurboTax for about 6 years and have been pretty happy with it. However, last year they started to charge for almost everything including clicking on the next button and the done button. I added this item into my wish list because it said "+ efile" and I thought okay for the price and I can efile for free I will buy. But with all your reviews I WILL NOT buy this time. I will try what another reviewer said and go onto IRS website and look @ what they offer. It will be hard at first to re-enter all the information, but it will be worth it! To print my doc it costs me money! Are your serious!!!
Again Thankx for all the reviews :) I check them before I buy a product.

OK, I admit it, I bought this machine because I thought it looked terrific, cool design, heavy duty manufacture, and I was fond of the retro-chic of the dials and switches, like an airplane dashboard from thirty years ago.  The machine, however, has several design flaws that have greatly mitigated my warm feelings.  
For one thing, the water reservoir into which you pour the water is located in the very back of the machine, next to the hinge for the lid.  It is awkward to use, the opening is too small, and your water often either splashes out of the back or into the coffee grounds.  
Second, the hot water comes out of the lid and onto the grounds, but when closed, the lid is too close to the grounds and gets a lot of backsplash.  The grounds end up adhered to the lid which must be wiped off every time you use it or it will clog.  But when you wipe it actually pushes the grounds into the spray head.  Also, if you fill the (too small) gold filter while it is seated in the machine you are very likely to get grounds into the water reservoir which then necessitates a difficult cleaning of the entire works.  And I suspect that even if you fill it and then place it in the machine, the grounds sometimes get splashed into the reservoir during the brewing process.  
The gold filter that fits this machine is too small.  We like our coffee strong and if you put in enough coffee for a whole 12 cup pot, it expands into the works and again clogs everything making you have to clean it.  
Lastly, within about two weeks of our purchasing the machine, the little thingy at the bottom of the filter holder fell out (it is held in by a rubber band) and now we can no longer pull the pot out in the middle of the brew cycle (a convenient feature for those of us who are impatient and/or in a hurry) but must wait until the whole pot is made to get that first cup.  
In sum, a beautiful and indeed heavy duty machine, but quite flawed.  I liked our old Braun maker much better.

I labored for many hours over my Turbo tax return and finally gave up.  My disc did not contain any of the basic tax forms.  The notice stated that the forms would be ready in November, 2007!  It said I could go to their website to get my forms but I couldn't find them there either.  One notice stated that I could "find One-click Updates from the Online menu to connect to our website."  I don't even know what that means.  I certainly could not find anything like those things.  Phooey! (That's a cleaned-up version of what I really feel!)

This review is from: The Dark Knight (Two-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy) (DVD)
      
We've all seen the movie (many of us multiple times) and the general consensus is that the film will be winning many awards. No need to keep repeating what everyone already knows. This is simply a review of the DVD, NOT THE MOVIE. 
Let's get right to the point..The Dark Knight Two-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy  has nothing special in it. This "Special Edition" DVD has NO directors and/or cast commentary, NO deleted or extended scenes, NO cast commentary, NO behind the scenes or the making of feature, and NO special effects behind the scenes feature. Basically everything you would expect to come in a DVD (especially a Two-Disc) is not in this one. If you only watched the 2nd disc of this Two-Disc edition you would never know that the late Heath Ledger was in it. There is no tribute or in memory of or any type of mention of Heath Ledger's death in this DVD. We all know we bought this DVD the day it came out assuming there would be more scenes of Ledger's "Joker" or some type of interview or extra footage of Ledger on set. Instead all we get with this DVD is basically the movie we saw in the summer transferred to a disc for us to take home. I could have just brought a camera to the theaters and taped it myself if I would have known that's all I would be getting by paying another $20 for this so called "Special Edition" DVD.
It is quite clear that the powers that be at Warner Brothers looked to capitalize even further on the box office success of the "Dark Knight" by pumping out this lame excuse for a DVD just in time for the holiday season knowing that we would eat up the DVD just as fast as we did with the film in the theaters. What's even more disheartening is that in about 3 months times from now, when the "Dark Knight" buzz has died down after the holidays and after the awards season, Warner Brothers will release the "Ultimate Edition" or "Extended Edition" DVD, whatever they end up calling it, this will be the DVD we all thought we were buying the first time around. Knowing that the film very well could walk away with a couple Oscars, a rerelease immediately following is a definite. We all saw the film enough times in theaters that we deserve a worthy DVD with all the appropriate features that compliments the film. Screw You Warner Brothers, I want my money back.

I read other reviews before trying this product, people saying it really helped them lose weight and that it cleaned out their systems (e.i. they pooped a lot), and I figured $8 was worth the try. So, I've used it for the past month, and I have seen no changes whatsoever. Upon reading from the websites for these Acai products, they say you should take it twice a day, drink lots of water and not eat after 7 pm. There's the clincher. Probably a lot of people who started taking this were not in the habit of doing those things already. I, on the other hand, already drank lots of water, watched my diet, and pooped pretty regularly. I even increased my exercise while taking this stuff and I haven't lost a pound (let alone the 10 or so pounds people claim to have lost). So, perhaps those who have seen a difference just weren't eating enough fiber in the first place and so of course they saw a difference. I figure if this isn't going to do anything spectacular, I'll just stick with my regular fruits and vegetables as usual.

Installation is easy,I like the Network magic software but I think its claimed wireless speed is a lie.I tried with D-Link Rangebooster N 650 adapter(DWA645).After I reboot the router,speed stay high for while then slows down over the time.Even LAN speed is very slow, slower than my old router (Netgear Rangemax WPN824).Sometimes, signal just drops and get disconnected.Wireless speed G or N is horribly slow.I already tried in many ways and I am really dissapointed with its unstable performance.

Just got this today and plug right in to my notebook to charge. It would shut down my notebook every single time when i plug this flip in. It's a quite disappointing product. The LCD is small and no zoom feature produces poor quality. I am not sure why there are so many other reviewers like this product. Do I ask for too much? Anyway, it does not work or even charge. I rather keep my notebook safe..so this one is going back to amazon. sorry.

I bought this to use with a hardwired home PC network and wireless connectivity.  The unit is fast and easy to set-up, but worthless with the current firmware.  One out of every ten attempts to connect to the internet fail intermittently.  A search for the problem found dozens of people having the same issue with the current firmware.  Linksys tech support has no current fix.  I am not running any special configuration or computers.  I was replacing an older netgear router and wireless router to consolidate to one device.  Everything worked perfect before the switch. DO NOT BUY THIS DEVICE... WAIT UNTIL LINKSYS HAS A FIX!

As a musician, I expect digital files to play on speed and at proper pitch.
I noticed on the Fuze that my mp3s sounded 'dull' or lazy at first.  When I compared them with my identical PC files (from a wide variety of ripping and purchasing sources)and found that the Fuze played off speed and off pitch.  This makes the Fuze unusable for any serious music practicing.  I can't be bothered to re-tune all of my instruments just to play against the tracks on the Fuze.  I wonder how digital reproduction could be butchered by Sansa's oversight.  This is not a phonograph or a tape player that is subject to speed variations.
I love the player in all other respects.  It went back for a refund and I got a Sony NWZ-438F that plays and sounds perfectly.

I used it twice then handed it down to my little sis.  I have curly hair so I flip my head upside down for a minute or two while I dry my hair.  It is so heavy it hurts my wrist.  There are too many other options out there to have to put up with such a heavy dryer.  
Positive note:  It has great gadgets.  I would keep it if it weren't for the heavy factor.

Short story: Do not purchase this device.
Long story: I purchased the Linksys WRT54G to upgrade from a B-only Netgear router. Out of the box, only wired connections worked. Not one of the 5 wireless devices that I have connected: 3 B-only devices, 2 B-G laptops. (Detail: I would get a wireless connection to the router but could not get DHCP addresses.)
Went online and searched, recent WRT54G firmwares had a bug with DHCP. Details were sparse, but everyone thought it was only their kind of device (Apple, B-only, internal laptop, PSP, XBox, etc). Setting a static IP didn't work for me as it had in some of the posts I saw out there.
My conclusion: Out of the box, you shouldn't expect non-Linksys wireless devices to work with the current incarnation of this router (purchased Dec 23, 2006).
The sad but fated conclusion: A new firmware promised to fix the bug, so I thought I'd be a power user and download it. Note to Linksys: if your firmware download page has seven or more downloads specifically for the WRT54G, you should give the end-user an obvious link telling them how to determine which WRT54G to use.
I submitted the firmware up to the router, and it went to a blank page that said, "Don't interrupt this." I understand you can't interrupt these things, so I went about other business.
After 15 minutes, the page hadn't auto-refreshed, so I opened another tab and logged in, and the router was chugging along with the old firmware. What's a person to do? Wait? Retry? Power-cycle?
Well, I won't invite armchairing by further details, except to state that the router briefly reported itself as running the new firmware, but still wouldn't DHCP my wireless devices, then wouldn't DHCP my wired device, and finally wouldn't respond at all (brick had been achieved).
I've returned to the Netgear brand with one of their new routers, and gee, plug it in and it works. The quick install sheet even has a section: "What if I'm familiar with this stuff and don't want to use the wizard?"

This review is from: Transformers (Two-Disc Special Edition) [HD DVD] (HD DVD)
      
As a fan of the Transformers cartoons, I was worried when I heard Michael Bay was directing the film. I did have some hope though since Spielberg was somewhat involved though. Too bad the movie was molded more from the creative liberties of Michael Bay's ego than it's source material. 
Some things that made this movie suck: Bumblebee playing cupid despite having more pressing things to worry about like Decipticons, Starscream's lack of any personality especially since he was one of the most entertaining personalities on the show, Optimus Prime tip toe'ing around a garden like a worried soccer mom, Barricade just kinda dissapears, Sector 7 was stupid, the government drama was horrible, the transformers seemed like more of an afterthought since they only came out a few times. 
If you liked the movie, great. Enjoy it. But I found it butchered by Michael Bay.

While the hardware seems to do what it should, the instructions are terribly insufficient even for someone of average computer abilities.  I have downloaded what information I could find and still thrashed about trying my best not to make an error that would unnecessarily erase data on the product or on my computer.  Of course, there is free help by phone but it is only good for 30 days with the clock running from the first call.  I wouldn't buy it again.

This book loses all aspects of Bella's and Edwards relationship.  You root for Jacob the entire time and wonder what the heck Bella is feeling for Edward and Edward does little to show WHY he loves Bella.  But this book is necessary to read to understand the 4th book in this series.  Overall, I loved the series, but I really disliked this book.

I have the v4 version and it worked great with my Macs running OSX when I first got it.  Easy, smooth set up and decent documentation, which is often rare for Mac users.  But just like so many of the previous reviewers, after several months my wireless connection would drop frequently everyday requiring constant power unplug/replugs.  I contacted customer support, tried everything including resets, and going through every Netgear router firmware available.  The router continued to work great with a wired connection, but that kind of defeats the purpose of a wifi router.  I just bought a Buffalo router to replace this one.

Not even close to the advertised speed - It takes forever to read and write files to this thing. Blue light or amber light doesn't matter if you have to watch it for so long - they're both bad.  I have a 8GB and I'm going back to it.
Writting a large number of files, it seems to just stop to catch it's breath, even with write caching enabled.
Very disappointed with SanDisk for this. Up until now, I've been very happy with the 4 other Titaniums I have
If I can't return this, then I'll give it to my son.

This will not be an actual review since the product never worked! After it arrived at the date specified, when I turned it on after 8-9 seconds and at the Acer logo, it shuts off no matter how many times I tried. Bad luck!
 The worst thing is the process you have to go through for a replacement: they (Amazon) do not believe you that the product is defective(!), they ask you to personally contact Acer, make a case number with them, provide the feedback to Amazon and then... after they receive the product, they will decide! 
 On top of that the technical support to Acer they provide, asks you first of all to provide credit card information and while saying that they do not promise your issue to be resolved they  ask for $85 to be available from your card just in case...!
 Why should I spend so much time, effort and more money for someone that does not believe what I am claiming?
 I know ( from I what I have read) the computer itself is a very good product but the resolution service, and troubleshooting of both Amazon and Acer is of the worst quality!
 After I spoke with an Amazon representative over the phone, they do not want to accept a replacement order without going through the above process so I am sending back the computer for a full refund!

I have had now this camera for several months, but only now I had the time to used a little more often, so I decided to leave my opinion for future buyers. If you are looking to this device as an hybrid, you will make the same mistake you made. Still picture are just simply bad, doesn't matter if you are in low light or in plain sunlight. Of course the ones taken in low light are much worse than the one in sunlight, making them worthless. Maybe my standards are higher the other reviewers but I think a picture taken at ISO 200 should not suffer from heavy noise artifacts!! If you are shooting in sunlight and look at you pics in the cam monitor, they will look fine, but as soon as you will look at them in your PC, you will discover that if you can save 1 out of 10 you are lucky.
I guess video is fine for the type of sensors, and being a low resolution you can expect much. In video mode, the camera is really good to balance the white. If you need to shoot in low light, you better set the ISO manually to no more than 200, and activate the high sensitivity. This will allow for a minimum noise impact in your video. Another thing I like of the device is the responsiveness. It is really easy to start shooting videos, with almost no delay. So, if you care more about catching the moment but you are not very concern about the quality of the results, I guess this device will work for you. Another thing many people were excited about is the ability to take videos at 60fps. There is a major issue in this mode. Because the camera is operating at double the speed, the auto focus system produces a lot of click noise (hard to describe in other way) that is picked up by the mic. If you are shooting in a quite environment, you will be disappointed by the results.
Overall I like the feeling of the camera, and I really wish it worked as described. I would NOT by it again. I will probably save some more money and get a high def camera. 
PS: other cons are the very short battery life, the almost useless image stabilization and the face detection features that almost never recognize a face, not even when you have it right on camera!!

What a mess!  I gave the ASUS away, thinking larger keys/screen would be worth the extra price. Here's what I got with the HP 2133:
1.  Touch pad sends the cursor bouncing around, you'll spend a minimum couple seconds trying to find it every time you use it.
2.  After two weeks of sitting on my credenza,  booting up produced ... nothing.  The unit wasn't dropped, abused,  the OS simply evaporated.
3.  HP's website doesn't recognize HP 2133,  HP 2133 Mini-Note,  etc.  You get the idea HP is ashamed of it.  The only way to get email to a service tech without a product number is to email the President.
4.  The first tech who called quickly realized the OS was ... whatever it was.  He shipped a dvd with SUSE on it.  I didn't ask the obvious,  why didn't HP ship it with the 2133 to begin with.  I tried to find tech info,  operating manuals on the website.  Good luck.
5.  The dvd loaded from an stand-alone optical drive,  thankfully,  I have one.
6.  The new OS is as screwed up as the first;  of course,  installing it wipes out everything on the computer previously.  The computer keeps asking for a hd password,  advising that the hd (actually the 4gig flash memory) is locked until the right password is entered.  Huh?  This wasn't on the OS previously.  
7.  I use the same password for everything,  I assumed it was from something on the OS before it blew up.  That password doesn't work on the 2133.  After four wrong guesses the OS finally proceeds,  recognizes f9, f10, f11, etc.  However,  without the password,  it's a circular firing squad,  back and forth,  till I give up.  There's a list of possible generic passwords for SUSE on the Internet.  None of them work.
8.  I wrote the President of HP again,  got an email from the head of the linux hp 2133 unit,  or something like that.  Who hasn't returned my calls or emails.  He did suggest via email that I should send the 2133 to him so he could straighten out the mess.  That's a first,  and confirmation for me that HP recognizes what a disaster it has brewing.
9.  Maybe I didn't know where to find the program, before it blew up I tried to watch movies,  .avi and .mpg formats.  Neither of which worked.  I've finally found a linux movie player on the internet,  problem is,  I can't access the computer to add it or test it.
10.  I've loaded the OS from the dvd three or four times,  after loading I get the 'enter password' screen.
11.  I like to think I'm a somewhat sophisticated user,  I go back to TRS-DOS.  Open Office, Firefox, work OK.  I've found linux requires far more effort to use than XP.  That was before it blew up.
12.  The cat loves flopping down anywhere the computer has been resting.  It's not quite hot enough to fix flapjacks,  but it's close.
13.  I stopped by Office Depot today to buy an XP for $99.  At checkout I saw the small print,  'this is only an upgrade of a prior Windows OS.' Of course,  there is no Windows OS.  I saved $100,  but don't have a notebook computer to take on a trip Monday.
14.  Complete XP is $200.  Spending $200 on XP to add to the 2133 is foolish,  I can buy the Acer Aspire One for not that much more.
15.  I told the tech at HP ... I haven't been fishing in decades,  but I'll go just to use the HP as a sinker.
16.  I've got an order in for Acer Aspire One,  $349 for the 1gig 120hd, XP at MicroCenter.  The keys are still kinda small and tight, I don't like Bill Gates, etc.,  but it can't be the disaster the HP has been.
17.  Save your money.  You'll thank me.

I received the DCC 1200 last week. It stopped after the water was halfway done. I sent it back and received another one yesterday. SAME PROBLEM!
I called Cuisinart and they told me it is also defective. Cuisinart then
told me to tell Amazon to stop sending me defective units!
Let's hope the third time's a charm. Otherwise they can take this
thing and shove it!
Edit:
I feel completely stupid. You have to have the top on the
carafe in order for it to push up the button on the coffee
dispenser. This is for the brew pause function. When pulled
out the button release stopping the drip.
I'm coffee maker stupid :-)
Anyone having the same problem make sure your cover is
on.
I'll call Cuisinart and have them make note of it to 
save them some unneeded returns.
Can I change my rating up from one star? 
I don't see anyway to do so.

I used K9 Advantix because I was bringing my dog with me on vacation into tick-infested woods.  I used three-quarters of the 20 lb. dose on my 13 lb. poodle.  Approx. 12 hours after application, she began to have terrible neurological symptoms, running in circles and crying, jerking and jumping.  Her nose became very hot and her breathing became rapid and shallow.  We were up all night.  By the time I got instructions over the telephone to wash it off with liquid dish detergent, it had been 24 hours.  She survived, but the cartilage in her throat has been damaged and her bark is permanently changed.  If you are using this product for the first time, PLEASE use only half the recommended dose and standby with the liquid dish detergent.  If your dog can stand it, you can apply the rest two days later.  The only antidote for permethrin poisoning is to wash it off with liquid dish detergent within the first 24 hours!  Many dogs have been injured, and deaths have been attributed to K9 Advantix.  If you feel you must use it, first read the horror stories on the internet.  Bayer Animal Health should have included on the box instructions on how to wash it off with detergent if there was an adverse reaction.

For examples:
(1)Irrelevant GUIs take away too much usable space from the screen.
(2) Apple seems to use it as an advertising tool, as often it would prompt me to purchase MobileMe and instructed me to sign up some tutorials at the Apple store etc. Compared to that, PCs are cleaner. 
(3) Stuff in trash can't be emptied, as they are locked by the computer.
(4) When you open a file directory, a new window will pop up.
(5) No Cut and move option for file managements.  You have to select one file at a time and copy and delete it if you want to move it to a different location.
Thus, despite me having received this computer for just a few hours,  I already dislike it.

Ok i had the sandisk 512MB and it worked perfect for a long time and it didnt matter how many times i dropped it it still worked perfect. Now when i purchased the 2GB it worked for exactly one day.It froze on me and i turned it off and turned it back on and it stopped working completley. I had about 323 songs on there. It dont matter how many songs you put on there the product is gonna run very slow...it also takes a long time to load all of the songs. ANd i wrote amazon about it and about it and no response. The reason they didnt respond is because they sent me another one mp3 player which was a very good thing. But the same thing happened but faster...i was so disappointed. SO i told them what happened because it just happened last night. So hopefull i will get a refund or get somethin free.

I just wanted to make a quick note here.  I purchased a Brew'n'Go about a year ago now, and while mine works fine, my sister had purchased one and had to return it because the switch didn't work properly.  When she replaced it with a new one, it had the exact same problem and just recently broke down altogether.  One problem I've had with mine is the ever increasing amount of coffee grind residue passing through the filter.  I mainly use my Brew'n'Go now for hot water when making tea or hot chocolate.  If you just want good hot water that doesn't taste like the microwave, then this is a good purchase.  If you want fast and good coffee, search on.

I have a really great review.  I never received Planet Earth because, after tracking my purchase, I discovered that it was sent here and then returned.  The reason?  Supposedly, there was an incomplete street address.  Can't imagine how that happened, because you can't navigate thru the order without completing the entire address.
Hence, I did not receive Planet Earth for a Christmas present I planned to give my husband. No, I do not want to reorder.

This review is from: Religulous [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)
      
Every once in a while a truly bad movie comes along. This is one of them. Bill Maher interviews a couple dozen adherents of religion with the goal of making them look stupid. He employs tomahawk journalism and condescending sarcasm, edits the interviews to suit his purpose, and chooses easy targets, like an evangelist who claims to be Jesus, an actor who plays Jesus at a theme park, and a "Cannabis Ministry" in Amsterdam. Sure, there are a few funny moments, but Maher mainly succeeds in looking horribly smug. When he tries to be personal and explore his own religious views, as when he interviews his mother, we learn nothing interesting. When he tries to be serious, as when he interviews a Vatican astronomer or Francis Collins, head of the Genome Project and an outspoken Christian, Maher looks like a badly uninformed and unprepared eighth grader trying to impress his teacher. Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, at the end of the film Maher intones with utmost seriousness, "for mankind to survive, religion must end." Okay, thanks for that amazing insight. This is a mockumentary mashup.

NO 3rd Party Firmware exists for this model. The problem is the amount of RAM (2/8Mb) and the OS is VxWorks and not Linux.
The version Amazon shipping is v5. If you want to use 3rd Party Firmwares, DO NOT BUY A WRT54G v5.
To find out which WRT54G you are buying look at the serial number on the box. If it starts with CDFB then it is a v5.
For the others who don't use custom firmwares, be aware that v5 is running on a new platform with new firmware (rev 1.00.00 as of Oct 2005) so problems may arise.

I will not be buying any more flat irons from Amazon. I bought 3 in a 1 month period. spent a total of 300 plus on them. The first one broke in 1 month, the 2nd in 2 weeks.

Honestly, this is a wonderful router. Works efficiently. But it just stopped working after about a month.
For the amount I paid ($50), the life span of the product was atrocious and pathetic.
MY ADVISE: just get the router from your internet service provider. In the long run, you are saving more. Trust me, I tried shortcuts...but in the end I paid more and eventually had to buy one from my Internet service provider (ATT)

TO MAKE A SAD STORY SHORT:
This died on me in three days.
TO MAKE THE STORY LONGER:
Even the best electro/mechanical equipment does fail occasionally and early failures are usually some kind of manufacturing defect that may only affect a very small percentage of devices that come off the line. Once a device makes it past a week or so there is a good chance nothing is wrong with that particular sample. So, there is a really good chance that this failure is atypical.
TAKE A CHANCE?
If you want to take chance on this drive (and if you do, the odds are in your favor) consider the following:
1. Almost any drive you look at on Amazon, if there are more than a few reviews, you will see reports of failure.
2. This drive is reasonably priced so if you get a good one you are getting a good deal. Be sure to look over to the right hand side of the product page and pick the seller with the best deal. As of this writing it could be a difference of $20.
3. The drive is easy to install and use. For USB it is as easy as plugging in any USB device (memory stick, SD card).
4. The drive does support eSATA (first generation, 1.5 Gb/sec).
BUT FOR ME PERSONALLY:
Once bitten twice shy. So a two star review. Let those who have had better luck give it the five star reviews. Things will average out. This attitude did cost me as I replaced this unit with something more expensive in the hopes that it will be more reliable: LaCie 301442U d2 Quadra Hard Disk 1TB eSATA/FireWire800/FireWire400/USB 2.0 External Hard Drive (Aluminum).
I now have a review posted for the LaCie drive.

Bought this and thought I got a great deal ($140). All three of my towers and one laptop have trouble detecting it. Also, it overheats in less than thirty minutes, even if it's just on. 500 gigs is nice, but not if you have to go through all this trouble. Lately it hasn't been detected at all by any of my computers. I'll probably remove the actual drive and see what I can do. This was totally not worth buying.

I bought this router months ago, and while it does send out a strong wireless signal, it frequently drops.  I don't have to restart the router, it restarts itself... but where it really bothers me is with online games... I get booted from the server in the middle of a game.. It's terribly annoying, and random.
Also, I thought I was getting a good deal with the rebate and all, but they never sent me my rebate and act like I never sent them anything at all.  Big scam, inferior product.  If I could get my money back and do it again, I'd shell out a bit more for a linksys or something else.

Ref:  SimpleTech 500 GB external hard drive.
I'm not a very happy camper.  I bought the hardware with the CD install disk.  Started to install using that disk and received a message that the disk had a Trojan Horse virus on it and my machine would not open it.
Then I emailed Simpletech.  Got a link to install software from their internet site, which I did.  After installing, tried to hit the back up button and was informed that I had to create a backup folder first.  This I did and then did a file dump.  It took over 2 hours for the file backup and compare, for about a 1.1 Gig backup.  I don't know if that is long or short, but that is the time it took.
Next, I tried to access my Palm Pilot calendar software, only to find out that all my calendar data had disappeared.  Emailed Simpletech again to find out why and they stated that their product did not back up or deal with any scheduling software, so their product had nothing to do with the mysterious disappearance.  (Note, in fairness, I had not been able to back up my PC scheduler to my handheld device since March of 2008 because of a software glitch with the palm software.)  
So then, I called PalmPilot software support.  They corrected the glitch that would not allow hotsyncing of the handheld and the PC, but were unable to find the missing calendar files.  I was on the phone with them for 3 hours.  And they charged me a fee for the technical support.
Bottom line, if you are going to back up your files on a Simpletech device, you should back them up somewhere else first, like a network backup source if you have access to one, so if the software messes with your other programs, you are protected.

Originally, I was looking for a trimmer to keep my beard to managable lengths.  I was pretty sure that this thing wasn't designed to take care of that, but I figured I'd get it anyway, as there were other areas that needed a trim as well.
First, as most reviews have said, this thing is worthless when wet.  It's not like it just doesn't cut close...it doesn't cut *at all.*
Unfortunately, what most reviews don't tell you is that it's almost as worthless when dry.
I tried in on the back of my neck/shoulders, and it failed miserably.  Even with the guards off, where it's supposed to "completely" remove the hair, it barely made a dent.  Ok...maybe that hair is too thin/wispy...so I tried something a bit thicker, and went for my beard.
It shaved close there, but was very patchy.  Fine, so maybe it works better on thicker, coarse hair.  On to the armpits.  Yeah, useless there as well.  I pulled the skin there as tight as I could, stuck my arm in weird positions, did everything I could to make it easy to shave in that area.  Nothing.  Completely failed.
Ok, fine.  There's one other area that this thing may be able to redeem itself in.  I mean, a standard straight-blade razor can take care of the rest, but unless I want to change my religion, a straight-blade isn't going anywhere south of the belt line.
I will say this...on the groin, this thing works pretty well.  Cleans things up nicely using the biggest guard.  On the "boys," however, it's a no-go.  Just doesn't work for a damn.  When/where it *does* work, it's totally painless, so no problems there.  But for $40, this thing needs to work in more than just one area.

Before brewing my first cup of coffee, I washed all components, and ran hot water through a brew cycle. Before throwing out the water from the mug, I noticed an unpleasant hot plastic odor. Assuming it was from manufacturing, I repeated the hot water brewing cycle. The smell persisted. Another repeat. Then I ran the mug through the dishwasher. Finally, I made coffee. It brewed fast, the strength was good, but that plasticness overwhelmed the coffee.  It should be noted that while the included mug may have the look of aluminum, the interior is black plastic. I was happy with the speed and convenience of the brewing, so I tried a ceramic mug which fit in the space under the drip basket.  This gave me hot, decent tasting coffee,  but obviously not "to go". Luckily, I have an insulated all aluminum travel mug which just barely fits under the brewer, and by adjusting the amount of water and coffee I use, I'm now able to finally Brew and Go. This product is fine for quick single servings, as there is no hot plate to keep your beverage warm. There is simply no excuse for that mug.

This review is from: Transformers (Two-Disc Special Edition) (DVD)
      
 ...for saying that disingenuous Machiavellians are easily housebroken. That clearly wins the prize for being the most juvenile and impulsive thing I've ever heard. Let's get down to business: He says that hanging out with patronizing Philistines is a wonderful, culturally enriching experience. This is at best wrong. At worst, it is a lie. In the past, I've said that his modus operandi is to give lunatics control of the asylum. Were I to make such a generalization today, it would contain a few "weasel words" -- an escape hatch or that indispensable cliche that he descends from a long line of mumpish punks who like to clear-cut ancient forest lands. But because even those few who benefit from his announcements fail to recognize their current manifestation as a poxy, combative form of Comstockism, I am not ready to retract my conviction or to recant error. More often than not, the best thing about him is the way that he encourages us to lay out some ideas and interpretations that hold the potential for insight. No, wait; Optimus doesn't encourage that. On the contrary, he discourages us from admitting that he likes to compare his mottos to those that shaped this nation. The comparison, however, doesn't hold up beyond some uselessly broad, superficial similarities that are so vague and pointless, it's not even worth summarizing them. Once we have absorbed and understood his tyrannical wheelings and dealings, it is our inescapable responsibility to do whatever is necessary to take personal action and improve the physical and spiritual quality of life for the population at present and for those yet to come.
Yes, you heard me right; whenever Optimus announces that truth is whatever your grievance group says it is, his minions applaud on cue and the accolades are long and ostentatious. What's funny is that they don't provide similar feedback whenever I tell them that if Optimus were paying attention -- which it would seem he is not, as I've already gone over this -- he'd see that he is driving me nuts. I can't take it anymore! What's interesting is that we were put on this planet to be active, to struggle, and to illustrate the virtues that Optimus lacks -- courage, truthfulness, courtesy, honesty, diligence, chivalry, loyalty, and industry. We were not put here to scapegoat easy, unpopular targets, thereby diverting responsibility from more culpable parties, as Optimus might insist. I use such language purposefully -- and somewhat sardonically -- to illustrate how this cannot go on much longer. He may mean well but his equivocations are a cesspool of vigilantism. If you doubt this, just ask around. Optimus once used his notoriety, name recognition, and national fund-raising base to champion censorship in the name of free speech, intolerance in the name of tolerance, and oppression in the name of freedom. Now that that's cleared up, I'll continue with what I was saying before, that ageism is not merely an attack on our moral fiber. It is also a politically motivated attack on knowledge. The recent outrage at Optimus Prime's commentaries may point to a brighter future. For now, however, I must leave you knowing that he often uses the phrase, "Studies show that...", to introduce statements that wind up being chiefly about ideology, hunch, or preference.

This product was ordered twice and both times the product failed to be delivered successfully.  The person still has not received the product which was ordered on December 9th.  I am completely dissatisfied with the Amazon and the abililty to monitor their associated merchants.  It will be the last order I make with Amazon.

I sure wish someone (like Amazon?) could do some data-mining to objectively validate or discard an observation I've made after researching dozens of other reviews of this item.  Compared to the ratings of other coffee makers on Amazon(try Melitta or Cuisinart if you want to check this out yourself), it is fairly obvious that most of the *5-star* ratings for the Zoji are from reviewers who have posted no other reviews.  How many typical consumers go out of their way to rave about a product?
I'm now skeptical of a customer rating system that seemed like a great idea.  If one has to do extensive background research on all the reviews of every item they are shopping for, the system has no value at all.
I purchased this coffee maker after agonizing over reviews on Amazon and other sites.  The Zoji seemed to rank better overall than most machines with the features I wanted (thermal carafe and automatic brew timer), but after using it for a month or so, I'm sure there must be a better product out there. 
Honest reviews can be useful, but one needs to take even those with a grain of salt. I realized that one coffeemaker I was considering didn't rank as high as I'd like because some folks were dinging it for making coffee TOO HOT for them.  That reminded me of the well-meaning clerk who once dropped some ice into a cup of freshly brewed coffee because she didn't want me to burn my mouth. I nearly choked trying to stop her before it was too late, but then couldn't say anything because she had been kind enough to brew a single cup of fresh coffee late in the day, just for me. &lt;sigh&gt;
So, when I ding the Zoji for not making my coffee hot enough for my tastes (and yes, that includes when I preheat the thermal pot), it may be perfect for you...  IF you drop ice chips into your freshly brewed coffee!!
The unit is also very tall, which wasn't completely unexpected, but when the reservoir lid is open, the overall height is indeed extraordinary.
Like some of the other reviewers, I experienced coffee overflow when replacing the carafe under the basket after pouring a cup of java in the midst of a brew cycle.  I did discover that if I watched carefully and jiggled the carafe just right, it would interrupt the flow from the basket long enough to let the coffee drain into the carafe and it would then flow without backing up, but what a ridiculous dance to have to perform so early in the morning! I finally resigned myself to waiting for the darned thing to finish brewing, which thankfully isn't long.
Finally, what sadist designed the carafe lid?  The grooves across the top, intended to improve grip, are so sharp that one risks shredding their flesh trying to open and close the lid unless they use a towel or potholder to protect their hands.
The good?  It brews a good pot of coffee quickly and keeps it as very warm (not hot) as it was for a few hours.  It is easy to clean.
I fear I'd have been happier with a Mr. Coffee machine from WalMart for half the price I paid for the Zoji.  I'll use this one as long as I can, though I do plan to take the carafe lid to the basement to sand down the sharp ridges.
I may have given the Zoji more stars if the reviews weren't so obviously stacked in its favor.  It is WAY over-rated.

I will never buy a Linksys product again after my experience with this router. I am pretty good with technology, and figured installing a new router would take just a few short minutes (like Linksys says it should) but it took me nearly 2 hours to get it set-up due to the lack of information for Mac set-up as well as the horrible customer service I received. It was clear that customer service had little training with Macs (and were incredibly negative about macs while speaking with them) and were rude. 
Now that the product is set-up it still doesn't work very well, and even in my very small cottage I can not find a place in the house (even right next to the router) that I get all of my signal bars. I wish I hadn't upgraded at all after my experience with this product, and will never purchase a Linksys router again. 
Avoid this product, especially if you have a Mac!

This headset works satisfactorily. HOWEVER, the connection is via analog stereo miniplugs, NOT through USB as the product title states.  For an analog connection, the set works well enough.  However, for about $10 more, you can upgrade to the LX-3000, which IS the USB-connecting headset.
UPDATE ON 12/8/08: It looks like Amazon fixed the product title, which no longer claims that this headset is USB.  As advertised, then, I would probably up the star rating to a 3 or 4 because these headphones work as you would expect any analog connection to work: sound quality that is just "good" (not great and certainly not crystal clear) and mic quality that is only satisfactory for basic microphone functions where recording quality is not a concern.

Customer review from the Amazon Vine&amp;#8482; Program (What's this?)
      
I've been a Norton user ever since the olden days of Apple: The Mac Performa was the first color computer I ever toyed with.  I had Norton 6 (I believe) and loved it.  It was small, simple, effective.  I used the full Norton software on later PCs and found them to be bloated and memory hogging.  Not worth the money I paid for them at all.
Enter Norton 360.
I do appreciate the more silent footprint of this new Norton, however, all they did was lessen the GUI's presence.  The bloat is still there, you just don't see it.  Take a simple virus scan for example: I have a dualcore Centrino laptop and just a virus scan brought the poor thing to its knees.  Unacceptable.  Also, the cleanup works TOO well, essentially making Firefox "forget" everything even when you tell it not to.
The straw: the heuristic virus protection.  It blocks websites that are in no way dangers to your computer, and deletes software programs that are just updates or patches (not warez).  It assumes something must be dangerous just because it opens a port to function - guess what?  A lot of software might need to do that, including some of Microsoft's own.  It's no big deal.  IT doesn't even prompt you first, it just takes action.
I don't recommend this.  If you need total protection look into McAfee instead.

Dog training is about consistency, and this product is simply inconsistent. I live in a neighborhood with a lot of other dogs. I bought this product to solve a simple issue, my dog tries to take off after other dogs while on a leash. He is a large, strong willed German Shepherd. In order to be effective I had to use this device at about level 7 or 8 or he ignored it. At this level the battery life was quite minimal lasting me about 3 days at best. 
Lithium button cells are not inexpensive, it uses 2 and in just a couple of months time I'd spent more on batteries than the device cost me. They are also inconvenient to change, requires a screwdriver. Too many times I went to rely on this training device and it simply failed, dead batteries again. having to frustratingly switch gears to deal with the problem only encourages the bad behavior since it takes you out of the calm controlling posture required to be effective. 
I eventually gave up on it. Good concept, bad design. Would have been much better if it used less expensive, more common alkalines or rechargables.

I really liked Twilight (never as good as any of the HPs, but it was a good book), but after New Moon I knew I would hate the rest of the series-- and I do! I hope Meyers would fix all the problems in her storyline, but it seems her mind- at least in writing this series is as weak and flawed as her characters! I suppose it all was just a weak rip off of Wuthering Heights and Romeo and Juliet, but it lacks enough back-story to allow the reader to understand why so many of the characters are so pathetic, especially the main character, Isabella. You'll end up not liking her more so than sympathizing with her, and her man, Edward goes from being the sharp, keen type, to a pillar to hold up the asinine Bella.
**Series Recap**
Bella is totally pathetic, she's a weak, selfish, flimsy woman. She falls for the VAMPIRE WHO TRIES TO NO AVAIL TO CONVINCE HER LIFE IS WORTH LIVING. He leaves her to protect her, but she will only allow herself to believe he left because she is so worthless! (Which, as the series goes on, you may believe she is.) Through the series Bella laments time and time again, how unworthy she is, and constantly has some man to remind her of her importance! If you have a daughter with any kind of self-esteem issue PLEASE KEEP THESE BOOKS AWAY FROM HER!! Bella uses the young and innocent Native American (Jacob) as a crutch to survive her depression. She knows he loves her but won't deny herself the relief she gets from presence even though she knows she her only love is the vampire (Edward).
Jacob risks his life time and time again to protect her, he's called to duty in the first place because of her relationship with Edward. Despite all Jacob gives to Bella as soon as Edward needs her she tosses Jacob to the side to rescue Edward. When Edward vows to never leave her again, she more or less forgets Jacob, there are some extenuating circumstances but still she does not put up the fight for him that she put up to have Edward in her life. She disrespects her father, lies to her mother, and does all the things that would break any parent's heart to be with the vampire, and no matter how much she'll think of her poor parents, they're always some kind of afterthought. Granted, in the first book she tries to save her mom, but you'll soon see, if confronted with the idea of leaving Edward to spare them, she'll leave them to have Edward.
Bella refuses to accept that she cannot have both Edward and Jacob as they are mortal enemies, she's determined to have things her way and actually feels like Jacob is wrong for not giving her what she wants, which is to be her best friend while she loves the vampire...to make matter worse Jacob's people have always existed to protect mankind, while Edward is just an oddity who no-longer tries to destroy humanity. 
Through the series Bella causes trouble time and time again, but is always rescued. She never develops any self-esteem or any ability to take care of herself. At one point, she actually risks her life just to have delusions of Edward. She doesn't care about how her parents, or Jacob, who she uses to help induce these hallucinations, would feel if she died. She doesn't even care that she could be risking Jacob's life too! She abandons her friends and her family to be with Edward, who never really requested that of her. Edward has to fight with her to attend college, he has to beg her to have a normal human but she desires nothing more than to give it all up. She fears marrying Edward, but is dying to give up her soul to be a vampire; she at one point rationalizes that if she were a vampire, Edward would never want to leave her again...does that make any sense? Her value relies on rather or not a man- a vampire wants her, a horrible self-esteem lesson for every young girl, in a world where you hear of the abuse against women almost daily! A woman fought to be present, while books such as these teach young adult woman, a man is the beginning and ending of existence. I know it's a fantasy book, but books are meant as educational tools in one way or another. In Harry Potter the message is persistence, faith and overcoming, in Wuthering Heights it's a lesson on karma, and to do unto others etc...
Meyers gave her characters a happy ending they didn't deserve--and if they did deserve it, it's never explained why they did. She uses four pages, every time she mentions Edwards's name to explain his beauty, but practically never explains why he'd crave human love. Simply because he's a vampire isn't enough, because there are plenty of other vampires who get along fine, without love. Is it because he's lonely? She doesn't explain it, but in a way that's too bad too, if he were truly interested in Bella's well being and enjoying what he missed out on--a life. His actions however clearly show that's not the case either, so what? Is he just selfish? Hardly the kind of character you'd want to have a happy ending.
In the end she marries Edward, coaxes him into sex, gets pregnant which according to Meyers own outline should have been impossible. She's a young mom, who must hide the dramatic time from her own mother, who she professes to love so very much. She has the kid, and accepts and expects Jacob to protect it, but then gets angry when he does so the best way he knows how. Never mind the fact, that he is still in love with her, she's inconsiderate! She won't have him, but won't let him go either! And finally Bella and Edward live happily ever after!
It's a sick, sick series! You wouldn't know it by the first book, you'd believe it's a coming of age thing, that Bella will mature, and that you will see her relationship with Edward and Jacob actually gain some substance. Through the series, you're never given any actual reason for the love, not between Ed and Bella or between Jake and Bella. With Edward especially is seems more like lust or some kind of spell, because all she can ever talk about his how handsome, beautifully angelic he is and how his smell makes her forget her thoughts, how his breath lulls her to sleep-- total nonsense.
I know a love story is dramatic, heart wrenching, and usually someone gets jilted, but she takes it to a mental level. It should have some practical basis, or some redeeming qualities. It should make you believe in it, or admire something about it. In the case of The Meyers Series, all she gives you is a self-centered teenage girl who is incapable of not only taking care of herself, but Bella can't even spare others her destruction because she chooses not to. It also sends the message that all little girls need in life, is a man and a baby, and I've wondered if that comes from Meyer's Mormon upbringing? I do not mean to insult any religion, and I do not know anything about Meyers other than what I've read, but this series she's created is truly horrific. It exemplifies some sort of misogynistic idea; women, Bella is clearly the weaker, albeit more manipulative sex.
Spare yourself the trouble, read something else. I usually don't write reviews but this series was so idiotic that I had to say something. I know it's just a book and I know it's a fantasy, but just as we try to hold TV and music responsible for the messages, they send to the youth we must do the same with what our children read. It's problem enough to talk about losing your soul, it's another to happily give it up, but when you add in destructiveness, selfishness, mental illness in the form of self-esteem issues, you have a serious problem that doesn't need to be shared.

I bought this camera thinking that it would be an improvement over my Fuji S6000fd digital camera (it records movies as well). I use it to record my sons wrestling matches. The video is just as grainy and ugly as my digital camera if not worse. Maybe this camcorder will work well outside but if you're thinking of using it indoors, look elsewhere.

First--I am new to the Twilight Saga, and I've decided to review these books in order, as I read them.
Second--I'll admit I genuinely enjoyed the first book, Twilight, despite its flaws (which one only has to peruse the numerous 1-star reviews for to get a sense of what those flaws are). I gave it a fair 3-star review, just for the sheer FUN I had reading it.
So why am I giving New Moon only 2 stars?
1) I realize I'm not the first to point out that Stephanie Meyer's first-person style of writing often reads like a glorified fan fiction.  Indeed, I have read numerous fan fictions that invoke many of the same characteristics that seem to be ubiquitous in Meyer's writing: inane details, unimaginative surroundings, lengthy paragraphs describing feelings and emotions, too-convenient circumstances, and ridiculous plot devices--all told from a very "Mary Sue" type of perspective. However, I was hoping Meyer had gotten most of these things out of her system in Twilight, but they regrettably return in New Moon, to an even more laughable degree.
2) The story in this book really let me down. Without giving too much away: We finally get to see Bella on her own, left to her own devices, making her own choices. And I kept waiting for her to get ANGRY at her situation; to finally grow a spine and be the independent girl I was hoping she'd be. But it never happened.  I thought Edward's decision in the beginning would take this series an in an entirely new direction; allowing Bella to flourish in her freedom and pursue her new found desires. Instead we get chapter after chapter of suicidal thoughts, reckless behavior, using people, lying, and hallucinations, all for the sake of someone who, in my opinion, does not deserve her affections. It felt utterly pathetic to watch this unfold. 
3) By the end of the book, I had the nagging feeling that this series has already long since "jumped the shark" and that New Moon was just Twilight's extended denouement. I enjoyed Jacob's story (even though its emergence could not have possibly been more predictable) but couldn't help but feel that it was all filler. I was almost certain all the involvement with Jacob was going to build up to and play a major role in this book's climax, but no. Instead we get an angsty and entirely self-inflicted pointless conflict so ridiculous that it almost seems like Meyer went out of her way to allow it to happen. And just as ridiculously, it was all swept under the rug and forgiven with very little action or consequences.
So why did I read New Moon? And why do I plan to read the next 2 books?  Why do I have an infuriating desire to WANT to like these books?  The correct answer, I suspect, is a carefully-mixed cocktail of brilliant marketing, movie hype, and a basic storyline that is specifically meant to appeal to readers of literature's lowest common denominator--trashy romance novels.  Yet I will keep reading because, despite my complaints, I do care about the characters Meyer has created, even if I don't care for the way she writes them; which seems to be without subtlety or any true depth.  There have been so many times in these first 2 books that the story has hinted at taking an interesting or unexpected turn, but instead continues along its predictable and unimaginative path. I sincerely hope that things will get better in the next 2 books.

I was excited at the chance to buy any dragon naturally speaking, and expected to buy version 9.  when i went looking, i found new release version 10...read some reviews, compared versions, etc for several days before purchasing.
first, it took 8 days for it to arrive in the mail, too long.  read the manual 1 day 1st before even trying to intall software - the book is very skimpy and doesnt address troubleshooting, but then it doesnt even have the company's website listed on/in it...that should have been a sign.
then ive been frustrated for 3 days trying to install this software.  nuance help files, faq, and especially the index are absolutely horrible.  and yes, they say they will charge you for any help, whether by phone or email, which is absolutely stupid after paying 190$ for the software in the first place.
1st problem was the C++ runtime/reboot error, where repeated rebooting doesnt fix the problem.  the nuance knowledgebase had several possible fixes, including a zip download, none worked.  i found a forum elsewhere that said to just go to C:/program files folder and look for the new dragon folder to delete it (bcs install was created and started, but not finished, so you wont lose anything anyway), and sure enough that solved the problem.  rebooting and running dvd again then installed the c++ runtime that was needed.
2nd problem then was trying to install the dragon naturally speaking.  it started installing, then some english cab file has an invalid digital signature, and instead of passing over it or using it anyway, it "rolled back" and wouldnt install any of the files.  at least this error had a code "1330", which nuance knowledgebase had listed, and their solution 1 (of 3) worked, which is that you have to copy the entire dvd to your harddrive desktop, then run the install from the desktop instead.  
3rd, then even while doing this, it wouldnt copy one of the .ini files, so i just was able to skip it. 
 
finally the software installed.  happy days, i thought.
i then tried to run it.  a "serious error" occurs when trying to initialize and run.  no code numbers, no other info, and no clue as to what a "serious error" means or what to do about it.  ARRRGGHHH !
the stupid nuance index was clueless for a bit, but finally on the index word "initialization", i found the tech response.  a cpu must be able to use SSE2.  
never heard of it, but wikipedia helped.  end result is that your cpu has to be built since 2006 to have sse2 capability.  there is no way to add SSE2 instructions to any other types of cpu/chips.  so, altho i have an 1.8 gh amd processor, which is what is stated in the minimum requirements, my processor was built in 2003 and thus is incapable of ever running this software.
++
so, if you have an older-than-2006 cpu, or also if you have such a new cpu that it runs 64-bit, DONT BUY THIS SOFTWARE, you'll never get to use it.  this SSE2 requirement SHOULD HAVE been included in the CPU requirements both on amazon's site as well as on nuance's site so that you would check this stuff out before purchasing and returning software.  
after finding this error, i did find another tech forum that addressed using dragon n s 10 and SSE2 requirement that is kept a big secret by nuance, and they suggested too, that nuance should either put it on their website, or on their box, or in their manual, or in their knowledgebase, or somewhere.  
i agree, as i wasted 3 days of time over something that i knew about my computer, had it just been listed somewhere as a requirement.
but any company that charges for tech support for even the initial installing when you pay 200$ or more for the software, especially when they dont have a sufficient troubleshooting knowledgebase, is a company that i dont care to do business with.  i am returning this product, and i better get my f*&amp;(*&amp;#$g refund from these screwy people.

Be aware that while this product is advertised as having closed-captions for the hearing impaired, it fails to include subtitles.
High-definition inputs do not carry the closed-caption channel.  Without subtitles, the hard of hearing will either need to view this product over lower-quality analog inputs, or muddle through sans captions.

I received this as a gift to replace an older food processor that I purchased for $5 at a yard sale.  I was excited to upgrade to a larger capacity model with more power, but I have been very disappointed.  This food processor is heavy, somewhat complicated to put together and take apart, and nearly impossible to clean.  There are many nooks that get food in them, and are impossible to reach with a sponge. 
I have also had a lot of problems with the food processor leaking when I'm pureeing soups and sauces.  
If my old food processor still worked I would go back to using it, and sell this one at a garage sale for $5.

If you're used to faster than 900 speed you'll be disappointed when you expect this machine to function as your desktop does. Have researched CPU upgrades and they are minimal.

Perhaps I just got a lemon, but I just spent 4 hours trying to get this thing working, with no success. I have set up several other Linksys wireless routers as well as a Dlink wireless router in the past, so it's not as if I don't know what I'm doing. But I just can't figure out what this thing's problem is.
For one thing, the setup disc that was included with the router only works a small percentage of the time. Most of the time, when I had my laptop plugged into the router via ethernet cable (as the setup program instructs you to do), when you get to step 4, which is "plug the router's power cable into the electrical outlet", the setup program will sit for five to ten minutes only to tell me that my ethernet cable is not properly connected. Uhh, what? I eventually found out that if I re-run the setup program and/or reboot my laptop several times, it will get past that problem, only to get to another problem:
I get to the point where the setup program asks me to input settings for SSID, router login/password, and security (I tried, WEP and WPA, as well as unsecured). I do all that, and from that point forward, nothing will connect to the router via wireless connection. I tried my laptop, my ipod touch, and my blackberry, none of them were ever able to connect. Ethernet connection works, but no wireless. I also noticed that the wireless indicator light on the router will mysteriously stop illuminating until I power cycle the router. Perhaps this is part of the problem. Windows suggests it's a weak wireless signal, but I'm never more than ten feet away from the router.
But wait, there's more. Once I get the network set up via the setup disc, I can no longer access the router config page (192.168.1.1) from my browser. I can access it before I run the setup, but not after. It prompts me for my name and password, I enter them and hit enter, and it simply brings up the login window again, as if I typo'd. I tried the default login here, but that didn't work either. So again I have to reset the router with the reset button on the back.
After 4 hours wasted on trying to get this piece of crap working, I gave up. There is no way in hell I should be running into this many problems. Like I said, I have setup several wireless networks in the past, most of them Linksys, and one Dlink. They were all very painless, none of them took me anymore than 1/2 hour to set up a secured network from scratch. So this piece of crap is getting exchanged for either a Linksys WRT54G or a DLink (can't recall the model number offhand), both are G routers that I recently setup for relatives, and I was able to get my laptop, ipod touch and blackberry connected to them without a single issue.
UPDATE: I was able to get the router working for about half an hour, by simply moving it to where it was approximately five feet away from my laptop rather than ten feet. Only thing I can figure is something where I had originally placed it was interfering with the signal. However, after half an hour, I suddenly lost net connection, and the router disappeared from the list of wireless devices, so I was unable to reconnect to it. All the lights were illuminated on the router, yet it just disappeared to where neither my laptop, ipod touch, or my friend's iphone could no longer see it. That's the final straw. This piece of junk is getting returned. Horrible, horrible product.

We bought this coffee maker in April 2008 after we got rid of our 10 year old Mr. Coffee maker. We were pleased with the auto on feature and this model worked great for us until one day it just refused to begin brewing.

This is the most formulaic summer movie I have ever seen.  Stuffed full with celebrity cameos, overblown special effects, and blatant product placement.  It's more a 2 1/2 hour GM commercial than a film. 
The characters are all one dimensional and the plot is predictable so I never really got into the film.  I know for sure I will never watch a Michael Bay movie again having been disapointed for the last time.  Also Shia LaBeouf is the most ridiculous leading actor in a movie since DJ Qualls in "The New Guy".

I have been using generic minoxidil 5% from various suppliers for years. Recently, I ordered the 4-month package supplied by Kirkland. Guess what, after a month, my hair started to fall again. Although on the label, it is 5% minoxidil, there's no way for me to test whether it has 5% minoxidil or not... So I stopped using this one and quickly ordered another generic minoxidil from a different supplier and my hair loss seems slow down now. So conclusion: I will never buy minoxidil from Kirkland anymore.

I used TurboTax in 2006 for the first time with no complaints. Then again, my return was pretty simple. I basically bought it because I am no good with numbers and felt safer having a double check for myself.
This year I purchased again and it was horrible! My return was more complex, having purchased a home and having multiple work deductions. All said and done, TurboTax told me I owed about $1100! After a moment of panic, I called a lifelong CPA who was a friend of a friend and took the same documents in to him. Looking over TurboTax's work he was amazed. He told me it was all wrong. Numbers were in some forms and not others, the wrong forms had been used, and some things I could have deducted weren't there at all because TurboTax's "Deduction Maximizer" didn't tell me I could.
All said and done, we saved over $500 by his redoing our taxes and got tips on getting more back next year. Plus he E-filed for free. TurboTax charges you $18 for that. 
In addition, their customer service stinks. I have a hard time finding someone to speak English and when I asked about the "Satisfaction Guarenteed" refund he started asking for my private information to "pull my record."

This review is from: The Dark Knight (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)
      
Last night a friend invited me to watch the DVD with him and his two kids - aged 10 and 14. The 14 year old saw Dark Knight 6 times in the theater.
In watching, I was reminded of the terror wrought in Mumbai a couple of weeks ago. The whole world was shocked and disgusted by the senseless killing spree perpetrated by a gang of thugs hyped up on drugs and somehow convinced that shooting and stabbing innocent people supported their "cause". 
I suppose if a film crew was able to recreate the Mumbai melee and amp it up with state of the art special effects and high definition, explosions, pounding music and high profile actors, the resulting movie would be huge hit. 
It bothers me that violence and evil are such a huge attraction for mainstream audiences, especially our younger generation. That they're all "gaga" over Heath Ledger and his portrayal of the criminally sadistic Joker - and his subsequent suicide - is a sad testament to what's important to our youth today, and who they look up to.  
In summary, I can't imagine how much better I would have felt if I had taken a walk down at the beach and watched the sunset instead of spending two and a half hours with this movie that left me feeling awful.

I have been an avid Norton Symantec user for over 13 years.  This is the worst product EVER. It slows your system down so much that I had to disable most of the features, which an average user will not know how to do.  
My biggest complaint is that once the "virus update" expires.. it renders the entire software useless. I couldn't even go in and make simple changes to the settings, nothing to do with the virus update feature. PLUS  A pop-up comes up everyday twice a day begging me to buy another year subscription. That is false. What they are really asking is that I buy the software again. Once a year is up .. you might as well throw it in the trash OR give it to someone else OR wipe your hard drive and install a fresh copy. 
I am not happy with it at all! I will never buy any anti-virus or internet security software from this company again.  I have heard of complaints that it will crash your system the day it expires. 
Uninstalling any Norton products are difficult and you should find a good article on the internet on how to do this.  NOTE: You must uninstall any anti-virus software if you are installing a different brand.

I saw so much potential for an amazing story...but I was disappointed on so many levels.  There were parts of this book that showed such promise.  Bella's change, the coming of the Volturi, the introduction of the new vampires (some of them were interesting or really had the chance to be).  Somewhere along the way, this book just lost itself. 
I am all for happy endings, in fact I crave them.  But just like in real life, I know that to get to the happy ending, there are struggles.  Bella didn't have to really face any.  She is perfect, everything goes her way, she has none of the struggles that anyone else went through in becoming a vamp, adjusting to life, battling the evil.  Just nothing.  
I'm actually struggling to leave this review.  I think so many people before me covered what was wrong with this novel.  The vampire baby, the gruesome way the child came into this world, and then.....just as you thought there would be complications having this child....BAM!  The baby is perfect.  Just like Bella. 
I can't even find the words to describe how saddened I was.  When parts of the book had potential to be amazing, they just floundered. When the storyline actually got interesting, banality took over and everything worked out just perfect in Bella's perfect life with her perfect husband and perfect baby.
I'm not going to go into all the spoiler's, there is no reason to as many people have stated them in a better way than I can at this point.  I will just say that I feel sorry for Stephenie Meyer.  She dropped the ball.  She had the universe, she had the characters, she had everything to make this an interesting read.  Instead she turned it into a travesty of itself and the series.  
Yes, the series was fluff and a total guilty pleasure kind of thing, but for some reason, I expected more.  Not this muddled mix of too many ideas that never really meld.  
You do get a happy ending, but at what cost?  No cost to Bella....only to the quality of the book and to what could have been an amazing story.

"DICTATE" by MacSpeech is a tragedy!    It's a tragedy for the normal user, but even moreso for the neurologically handicapped patients to whom it offered the opportunity to communicate more normally. 
If you were to bundle the potentially best voice dictation application for Mac that's on the market (and probably the best on the horizon) with one of the worst customer service group you can imagine, and heat that mix with the total absence of documentation on the disc or third-party, you'd know why so many reviewers are complaining that they've been defrauded.      
It's hard to assign some number of stars to an application with which you're having such a love/hate relationship.   Imagine buying Mac OSX Leopard or Microsoft Office with a technical support group that knows even less than you do and no users' manuals.  That'd give you a great OS or application, but it would take weeks to discover and implement one small fraction of what it's designed to do.     That is why I'd put off buying DICTATE by MacSpeech until they have a product to sell.  Then, I'd rush to buy it.

I've been using Quicken for over a decade, and I have to admit it is critical to my personal financial management.  But I had no reason to upgrade from Quicken 2004 until Intuit decided to "break" it and force the upgrade by crippling certain features.  Quicken 2007 for Mac's feature set is not significantly different from the 2004 version, much less 2005 or 2006, and is certainly inferior to Quicken for Windows.  That's bad enough but Quicken 2007 is also WAY less stable than my prior version (I'm using the R2 update).  It crashes frequently.

Another year's worth of eye candy from Intuit, with no substantive changes.

My financial institutions (e.g., Fidelity) that used to say "online features not compatible with Quicken for the Mac" still aren't compatible with Quicken for the Mac.  And it still refuses to remember where on the screen I left my windows.  
Meanwhile, the changes they do make are fluff.  I've always been able to schedule bills and payments in Quicken, why would I even want to involve iCal now?  
If it weren't for Intuit's practice of arbitrarily discontinuing all online connectivity for old versions of Quicken when they reach a certain age, I'd never upgrade at all.  I haven't seen anything actually USEFUL in a Quicken Upgrade in the past five years.

I bought this and it was great for about 5 uses.  Then the canister cracked and a foul odor came out.  Liquid with a chemical odor leaked out all over my counter from the bowl.  I sent it back for replacement and 3 months later, still no replacment bowl.  They claim it is on backorder.

I don't dislike the battery as such.  It's just that I bought it because Amazon says customers often buy it with Innotek pet collars.  The battery doesn't fit these collars, and Amazon should not let this pairing mislead people like me.  The Petsafe battery is a disk you screw in; the Innotak collars take a conventional cylindrical battery.  I wrote to customer support about the matter, but received an automated reply that didn't resolve it.  I note the PetSafe battery is still being paired with the Innotek collars.

I recently purchased a Kitchenaid Accolade Mixer for my well deserving mother-in-law for Christmas.  After spending the large amount of money I waited patiently to receive the mixer in the mail.  I was surprised to come home and find the mixer, in it's manufactured box, sitting on my front steps.  I was very surprised to see that the mixer was not placed inside another box as if to "hide" it's contents to others. 
On Christmas my mother-in-law opened the gift to find several large gouges (cuts) on the body of the mixer, and several scratches and dents on the stainless steel bowl of the mixer.  Needless to say, for the amount of money I spent on the mixer and shipping costs, I would like to think that the product is going to be in "mint" condition.  Now I have to return the mixer and wait a longer period of time to get a new one.  Next time I will be sure to shop in a store so that I have the opportunity to inspect any possible damages.

A lot of people liked this movie, but jeez, I gotta say I found it hard to get into and hard to believe in and I'm a Woody Allen fan, have been for a long time. But that scene with Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall in that restaurant in Barcelona when Javier Bardem saunters up to their table and says he wants to fly them off on his private plane and make love to both of them at the same time, come on!
These girls are American Hotties and they ain't a going anywhere with any dude short of Mick Jagger with a line like that. A girl as hot as these, probably Mick would have a problem, he is getting a bit long in the tooth, after all. But these girls, they go, that would never ever happen. Then having Scarlett move in with the Javier character and wind up not only having an affair with him, but with Penelope Cruz, the ex-wife,  as well -- well, well, well, a gentleman's fancy but not real.
And after only one night out in the grass, shagging with Javier and the Rebecca Hall character is madly, ever so madly in love, but she says nothing so that her best bud Scarlett can keep a-going with her threesomes. Madly in love with the Javier character, but marries the dud fiancee anyway.
Oh, Woody, What Were You Thinking? It's hard to believe this was made by the same man who gave us Annie Hall.

I've been a heavy Office 2004 Excel user for the past two+ years.  I was severely disappointed when I installed Office 2008.  Microsoft elected to omit functionality that is core to being productive in Excel - solver support, data analysis, Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), and more.  If you rely on Excel to do any type of business analysis or are a student that will require access to data analysis tools (regression, histograms, distributions, etc.), you will be SOL with 2008.  I highly recommend that you avoid Office 2008.
Office 2008 is so incomplete and unsuited for professional work that it prompted me to write this review, which is my first.

This book is mostly about fast foods and fast food restaurants.  It says eat this fast food not that fast food.
I was hoping for a book that spoke to substitution for real foods.  I wanted something that said substitute this real food for something similar that is less fattening.  What it doesn't say is things like: don't eat butter when there are wonderful jams that have no sugar and are just 10 calories a spoonful.  It also doesn't say things like: don't make your dip from sour creme use yogurt instead because yogurt tastes just the same as sour creme in a dip and is less fattening.  
I never eat in McDonald's and those other places because everything sold there is very, very, very fattening regardless of any substitution you can make there.
I am disappointed with this book.  It is just an exploration of fattening fast foods.  I had hoped for something with more substance.

This is the second one of these I've had the (dis)pleasure of working with. Fortunately I only bought the first one... 
1) Wireless stops working 1-2 times a week. Sometimes power cycling works, sometimes resetting from scratch works. Sometimes neither works. However it might be overheating... I just put it in the freezer since I noticed it was warm and its back working... When you ping the router when it starts misbehaving it times out or gets responses like 768ms. Plugging directly into the router when it acts like this works, but what's the point?
2) Internet access is consistently slower than everywhere else and we have cable.  
I have installed the latest BIOS update for this thing. My roomates get feisty when they cant get on the internet and I am an IT professional.. hehehe. They are starting to doubt my skills!

I had one of these for five years and had no problems; made great coffee with no mess.  I just replaced it and am now on my third one in three weeks due to overflow from the basket.  I put only half of the max. amount of grounds in and am still having the grounds back up to the top of the paper filter and into the spray mechanism.  Have tried everything Cuisinart recommends:  Different filters, different grind of coffee, different carafe placement, charcoal filter in, charcoal filter out, etc.  No luck so far---never had this problem with my old one (exact same model).

It should be said, first and foremost, that this movie is brilliant. I really think, between this movie and "Batman Begins" that Chris Nolan has set a new standard for comic-book based movies. He's proven its possible to take them and make them accessible to people without being campy, to include real emotions, even drama, believable and entertaining action sequences, all in a story that is handled seriously. That said, all the performances in this movie are anywhere between great and brilliant, no complaints.
Now where this disc goes wrong is its rather intolerable switching between 16:9 and letterbox (2.4:1) format. The creators of the disc clearly wanted to showcase their occasional use of i-max film, but they must have neglected to realize that not all of us have a 100 foot wall onto which to project these pristine images. The result is that you get sequences where Batman jumps off a tower in Hong Kong in 16:9 (full screen for modern televisions) and the people wandering around in the building 2 seconds later are in letterbox, you see him flying around and crashing through the window in full screen, and then he rolls to a halt in letterbox. This is actually a simplified explanation of what actually happens, because there are actually 3 or 4 more switches back and forth in that one action sequence. Needless to say, it is quite distracting. Its completely bizarre that whey chose to do this, really. I'm sure they were thinking its a good idea, but everyone I've shown it to is not impressed.
Your options? You can live with this, because its not an option to change it. You can buy the DVD which isn't like this, though it is clearly not the same resolution. You can wait until Warner Bros releases another version, which may never happen. What is clear is for the moment you won't be enjoying this movie to the extent you should in HD at this point.

I have two long-haired cats, and within a week the pump was completely clogged. The little grate that keeps hair out of the pump is almost useless. Taking it completely apart and cleaning did restore flow for a bit, but now, after a couple of months, even that doesn't work anymore. The 'waterfall' has slowed to a trickle, and I suspect the pump is just about dead. Also, the bottle only holds a day or so of water, so for longer trips, I have to break out my old gravity-feed bottle anyway.

This book is not what I expected.   Most of the meals take TIME to cook, and TIME to shop for multiple ingredients, which is great if you don't have a full-time job and driver duty for after-school activities.   Almost nothing can be prepped ahead of time.   Most dishes have at least one expensive ingredient, or use only part of a package (what do you do with the rest?).  Many dishes have seasonings or flavor combinations that a young child won't tolerate (at least mine won't!).  This cookbook is better titled "The Biggest Loser Family Gourmet Cookbook."

I've enjoyed using this recorder, but I've run into a problem you need to be aware of.  I taped a 4 minute video recently, with the intent to use the enclosed software to convert it for email and send it to family.  The software would not convert the video.  And after many seemingly "canned" responses from tech support that didn't address the problem, I was finally told that 4 minutes was too long to convert and that I should make my videos shorter.

I was very disappointed with this film. Given the strong connection to Xavier Herbert's book "Poor Fellow My Country" (and hi earlier "Capricornia"), acknowledged near the end of the final credits, it would have been better to get a bit closer to either the facts or Herbert's stories. The beef baron was actually English, not Australian, and the kow-towing to the English was much greater in reality. The separation between whites and aborigines was far sharper and harsher than  portrayed, and remains so, albeit significantly lessened these days (I lived in Darwin for some years). The peer pressure to conform to the social norms was far greater than portrayed. When was there ever an aboriginal woman who couldn't swim, or at least float? And where are these big cliffs and deserts between Katherine and Darwin? Herbert also viewed the behavior of many people in Darwin at the time of the first  Japanese bombing as quite shameful, and the conclusion of "Poor Fellow My Country" was anything but upbeat: it was a tragedy, pure and simple. The courageous died or disappeared, and the drones and the mindless mob inherited the Earth.
So, watch "Australia" for the scenery, for the cinematography, for some false nostalgia, a spot of romance, and some feel-good stuff, but don't mistake it for any kind of reality, past or present.

Five members of the family read this book (including four middle school/high school members) and overall it receives an average 2 rating (the first three all were ranked 5 stars). Honestly, as one reviewer already said, it felt like someone completely different wrote this book.  I think that the more mature viewpoint of Edward and Bella (and baby), might have made more sense if a fourth book had transitioned their story (and Jacob's involvement in the triangle)to a fifth.  Additionally, the conflict with the other vampires, which had been more of a subplot before, needed another book to transition to the major plot.  Essentially, the first three books were fantasy/romance novels; this one read more like a fantasy/action adventure with a romance undertone.  Jacob is the only character that seemed consistent with the past for most of the book (though his personality was a bit watered-down with the imprint issue) and the change in Bella's father was a major disappointment. At the end, we all found ourselves longing for a less "happily-ever-after" and a more "realistically-ever-after" ending.

Pros: Elegant styling, decent build quality, easy to use, carafe stays cool outside which is safer with little ones probing hands around
Cons: Coffee flavor harsh and coffee temp too low even at brew time, much less any time later
I bought this after seeing the largely positive reviews, and now regret it.  Coming from a Krups (10 year old model) to this was a massive let down.  The coffee in the pot and during brewing is 15*F and 10*F colder respectively than my old Krups (measured with probe) and both taste and ability to add cream (and still have decently hot coffee) suffer.  
This is before even considering the carafe, which doesn't do a creditable job of keeping the coffee warm if not preheated or not full (or both).  
If you're looking for a machine to make full pots on demand, and can handle the somewhat harsh taste of the coffee, by all means this is the machine for you. Other than these sore spots, it is excellent (but what use is bad coffee?).  
If you prefer a smoother, richer cup of coffee and wish to use the timer to make a half carafe or so in the morning, cross this one off your list right now. Run, don't walk.

Customer review from the Amazon Vine&amp;#8482; Program (What's this?)
      
If your highest priority is interoperability with documents produced by various  versions of MS office or you want a Mac application with some level of Exchange server compatibility, or you need one or more of the features only found in this product then this product may be for you.
Otherwise you are far better served with other Office applications like OpenOffice or iWork.
As usual, MS has produced a bloated, slow, leaky, buggy suite that features frequent crashes and frequent large and temperamental updates.  The interface is neither fully Mac like (nor does this operate like most mac programs in many ways), and neither is it fully PC or Office 2007 like.  If installing a new version beware that the MS supplied uninstall does not completely uninstall a previous version and you won't be able to use a new product key without cleaning up some preference files Office squirrels away.  The SP1 update is also a real treat, popping up an error message window behind the install window that makes it look like the install froze.  More of the same from MS.
Since its only redeeming features are MS Office compatibility, a unique (large) feature set, and some level of Exchange server compatibility, there is really no point to this version since you would be just as well served by the Standard version of Office 2008.  There are many other programs that do a far better job on the Mac than  the "Expression Media" materials that distinguish this version from the Standard version.

I have used many linksys wireless routers, and this linksys router is very average.  If speed is your thing, this router is DEFINITELY not for you.  if you need a big range, this router will disappoint you.  I live in a 2500 sq ft house and this router will not deliver good signal throughout the house.  This router will be good for about a few weeks, but later on, you will probably need to reset it every so often because your wireless connection will be dropped.  If you are looking for a good reliable router for your house, I would suggest the D-Link DIR-655.  If you want a regular router for a medium size apartment and you don't play a lot of games or downloads, this router will fit your most basic needs, nothing more.

I so wish I could have given this 5 stars. I recently lost my previous Sony Camcorder [Model DVD92--also mini dvd recordable] and I loved it. I never expected this 610 one to suck so hard.
In general, what's great about Sony's dvd camcorders is that they really are easy to use and take great family videos. I agree with all the reviews that praise the user friendly just pick-it-up and use it accolades. This review really has to do with what you do with that content and how IMHO the newer model is not an improvement over the older one.
The 610 Sucks because:
-Finalizing a mini dvd on my old one took 30 seconds, this one 7 min! [WTF?!?]
-On the mac, in order to edit the content you need to first rip the dvd with a program like handbrake and then hope imovie imports it with the chapters. A long and tedious process. I was told that the usb port could import the movie content on this 610 model directly-not true!-it shows up as a finalized disc, not a hard drive that you can drag/drop from. 
-The screen on my old one was actually better, this one has a lot of glare.
-I could flip the screen so my toddler could see herself on the DVD92 while I looked thru the viewfinder. On this one it does not seem you can use the viewfinder and screen at the same time.
Hope this helps! I am returning this one and trying the Sanyo xacti 1000.

Many people have commented on the typing and other features. I leave you to read those reviews for such information. I am here to write only about the touchpad not working.
I ordered one keyboard from Amazon and was quite happy with it upon arrival. However, the touchpad didn't work on any of my various computers (3 computers - 1 XP, 1 XP64, and 1 OSX).
Razer customer support was fairly helpful and only a little slow to provide an RMA. However, I chose instead to try again via Amazon. I requested a replacement and sent the first keyboard back to Amazon.
The second keyboard had the same flaw - the touchpad didn't function. I looked around even more on the internet and found this site:
http://www.artage.de/2008/03/10/razer-lycosa-problems-and-how-to-fix-them/
which led me to discover WHY the touchpad didn't work - a screw was hampering a circuit board connection. This problem is fairly common and even after removing the screw I had no working touchpad. I took the circuit board home and tested it - alas! It had shorted out. So the bad design (silly misplaced screw) apparently leads to a possible short on many keyboards. As a result the touchpad was not ever going to work on a number of these keyboards.
I returned the second keyboard and bought a Tarantula from Amazon instead. The typing is actually nicer on the Tarantula and is on-par with my Logitech diNovo which is a pleasant surprise. I'll review this keyboard later if I find no obvious flaws.

No need to repeat what's been said over and over again -- but even for a "fantasy" book, this one was over the line.  ***SPOILERS***
There is no great happy ending without sacrifice.  Except in this book, apparently.  The author spent a good deal of time creating a world whose rules she felt she could break.  The author spent a lot of time making readers think that Bella would have a hard choice and/or a big sacrifice, but she didn't.  And the whole Jacob imprinting on the baby was just W.R.O.N.G.  Not the age thing... the "replacement woman is the daughter of the original woman" thing.  
I gave it 2 stars because of the parts narrated by or containing Jacob (and I was Team Edward, btw).  His was pretty much the only voice that stayed true to the nature of the character.  Didn't care about Bella or Edward much at all and the rest of the crew? -- just pages of fluff.

I have never used Quicken before, but heard generally good review from friends and coworkers.  I used other Intuit software, like TurboTax, and have been reasonably satisfied with it.  I received an e-mail with an offer too good to pass up - Quicken 2009 Deluxe plus WillMaker Plus 2009, all for only $[...].  I was thinking about buy both any way.  Now that I played with Quicken 2009 Deluxe for several days (installed WillMaker Plus 2009, but haven't used it yet), I can see why Intuit was so eager to dump Quicken.  I hope WillMaker Plus 2009 will turn out to be worth $[...].  Quicken 2009 Deluxe really disappointed (even shocked) me with poor and unintuitive user interface which I thought was their strength.  I am a software engineering manager with 20 years of experience.  I would be embarrassed if my team produced crap like this.  Yes, I have seen worse, but it is puzzling that this product passed their usability test.  There are functional flaws as well.  Downloading transactions produces net balance that is completely out of whack with current balance.  I was hoping that it would download transactions for my mortgage account, but it does not.  Only option I see is online payment via Quicken.  I don't need that.  I have automatic payment set up.  For checking account, it shows transactions only in chronological order (oldest at the top.  most recent at the bottom).  Shockingly, there is no option to list in reverse chronological order.  I understand that the default be in chronological order to emulate physical checkbook register.  But no option to reverse the order??  That is stupid.  In many ways, it typifies their limited way of thinking in designing and implementing this product.  It just doesn't have the feel of well-thought-out software product.  Options/buttons are not where you expect to find them.  Too many bells and whistles scattered all over without coherent thinking.  They should focus on making the basics work properly, before adding bells and whistles.  Avoid this product.

I keep getting these crappy controllers as presents, so I'm going to spare countless others from getting them. DO NOT BUY THIS CONTROLLER. It has a bad feel to it, very breakable. Just because it looks like the Play Station controller, it does not respond as well. The D pad is very flimsy, in my opinion.

We love all of our other Cuisinart products, and were really hoping that this would be the answer to our long-standing search to find something better than the George Forman grills we had purchased in the past.  Our big beef (no pun intended) with the Forman grills was that they were so hard to clean.  We thought that the Cuisinart with the removable grills would be easier.
It is easier in that when cleaning the grill you can remove them, but the "non-stick" surface is not at all the sort of quality I had hoped for and the coating is so thin that anywhere the upper grill contacts the lower grill there are already bright shiny aluminum spots showing through.  We have only used the Grill for two weeks and we are concerned that the coating will not last.  We are very careful when cleaning to use only soft brushes and Dawn dishwashing liquid, but because of this the "crusties" that become hard-cooked when grilling burgers are very hard to remove.  The provided notched cleaning tool is not much help in removing them unless it is used vigorously in repeated scrubbing back and forth; probably a result of the fact that the notches are a sloppy fit in the grill bars.
We also find that if the burgers or meat are placed near the edge the run-off liquid will not be well channeled to the drain spout... a result of the grill bars being so low that they are not allowing drainage.  I like my burgers juicy, but we still want the liquid to drain rather than pooling like it does.
Using this as a griddle gave "OK" results, as did using it as a panini press.  The temperature control can be confusing with three dials and you will want to study the user's guide instructions carefully before you begin this sort of use.

I wanted to like this machine and was excited to receive it. Unfortunately the top wouldn't fit properly into the base and it had to be returned. I'm ordering a different brand today.

The concepts in this book are excellent for people with little or no organization in their life.  I've always made efforts to stay on top of everything I had to do, and was hoping this book would teach me something new to put squeeze a bit more productivity and efficiency into my daily grind.
Unfortunately, nothing in this book should be new to anyone who has put the slightest bit of effort into attempting to improve their productivity.
Then, to make matters worse, the book rambles and repeats (and rambles and repeats, and...).  Additionally, although I'm usually a pretty quick reader, but the inordinate amount of sidebar notes in this book slowed my reading, are extremely distracting, and provide zero added benefit.
I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because the material would be beneficial for some people despite the poor presentation.

This the third Lacie drive I bought. But this model (301302U) is really bad. I decide to return it. 
A: the  top and sides of the drive case were actually made of plastic-like material. In my opinion it is too soft for a disk case. The most important thing is that the plastic box is very very poor for heat dissipation. The bottom of the case, which is made of metal, is supposed to undertake the job of heat dissipation. But it does NOT work well. After few minute, the disk will be very hot. 
B: the disk is NOT pre-formatted and it is not ready for use at once. The introduction of this product has lied on this very important point! When you connect this drive to your computer for the first time, the drive need be formatted. There is a preloaded software "setup assistant", which should be run to format the disk. But this poor "assistant", which should be fired, does NOT work on my PC laptop. I tried on another PC, it didn't work either. This software may work on Mac, but it definitely does NOT work on my PCs. So, the statements of "the drive is pre-formatted for use across Windows and Macs, doesn't require any additional drivers, and is ready to go seconds after being removed from the box" in the introduction are totally untrue! 
C: the cable of the power adapter is very thin and un-shielded. It is even poorer than the power cable of my razor. I can't imagine how I could trust this product to backup my data. 
D: the USB cable is also of very poor quality. It is thin and short. I'm not sure whether it is shielded or not. The plug and the outlet of the USB fit very loosely. This is really not good for data transfer. I said the USB cable is short. It is even shorter than that of my mobile drive. So, it can't not be used for my big desktop at all. 
E: you can't imagine that the customer support is also poor. I can't find any really useful information about this product on the LaCie website. When you try to post a question, you have to register. After that, you have to wait and wait for answers. 
My suggestion: don't be fooled by the stunning appearance, especially the charming blue light. This is a bad drive poorly designed. And do NOT buy this model.

I am rating this a 2 only because you HAVE TO use the lousy software that comes with it.I would like to say that J. Henry said all that was going through my head. I don't have the patience for this...if I could just convince my hubby to try the comparable Sony we were looking at....it just didn't seem to be as user friendly....that might be something I can learn to deal with and overcome!

Nowhere in Turbo Tax's promotional material do they you say anything about their new pay-as-you-go pricing structure, which comes on top of their new software price increases.
 
Every new return you print/file after the first one will cost you an ADDITIONAL $9.95! But they don't tell you that until AFTER you've download and installed the software.
If you don't like these bait-and-switch tactics, buy TaxCut or TaxAct, which allow unlimited individual returns for no additional charge. TaxCut also allows you to transfer data from Turbo Tax 2007 returns.

Before anybody comes to the defense of Linksys, they should read some of the horror stories. My Linksys router would not function properly on either of my PCs, both produced by different manufacturers. The customer support was non-existent. In fact, attempts to contact customer support were ignored. 
Only after I purchased a New Gear router did I learn what reliable wireless Internet was all about.
I agree with the reviewer who compared his Linksys router to ET for the Atari 2600. Pure trash. Even the design is poor. My Net Gear router is less than half the size.
If you buy Linksys, be sure you know where the reset button is on their router. Also be sure you know how to reset your Internet connection. If you have a Linksys and it works, you are lucky. I assure you that if you ever had to contact their tech support, you would sing a very unhappy tune.

I have a 10-year-old Zojirushi bread maker so I was excited to get this coffee maker.  It is marketed as commercial grade so I didn't mind paying more for it.  Unfortunately, I would not recommend this coffee maker because of the carafe.  It is VERY difficult to open after brewing coffee.  Definitely not for the elderly or anyone who makes coffee first thing in the morning.
My other complaint is the plastic cap that goes on top of the carafe lid.  It is designed to keep the heat from escaping after brewing.  The problem is if you forget to remove it before brewing the next pot.  If you forget the coffee will end up all over your counter and floor.  It shold have been designed to prevent the carafe from fitting back under the brewer.

My dog has had the collar on for the past several days.  While he has barked numerous times, the collar has nly sprayed once.   Prior to purchasing the Premier Gentle Spray collar, I used the Multivet Deluxe collar.   I don't think it performed all that well either, but it did spray about 50% of the time when my dog barked and so it definitely worked better than the Premier one has so far.   I will say that the Premier collar has been easier to fill and turn on/off than the Multivet one.

I've been through FOUR of these expensive units. They work great on my Great Pyrenees dog. At least they work for awhile. Then I end up trying to figure out if the batteries are dead, then if the NEW batteries I put in were dead to begin with, and then I send it back for repair. Once I got back a unit that worked again - for awhile. Then I got back a unit that never worked again.I stopped sending in my broken units after that.
So - in desperation, and impending poverty, I switched to a shock collar; it was either that or what my breeder calls a "blue juice special". It also worked - and yes, I tried it on myself and decided that it wasn't cruel at all. But the punchline is this: the shock collars broke at about the same rate as the citronella collar. At least they were cheaper, so I didn't lose as much money.

On July 9th of 2008 I purchased this unit primarily due to such outstanding reviews I found on Amazon.  For the first month I was as happy as all the five star reviewers.  I really loved the unit.  Last week the unit stopped exporting my walking details to the software (which is the feature that I liked most).
After calling Omron, they recommended that I take the sofware off my computer and attempt to put it back on.  And that if that didn't work, the problem most likely came from a default in the unit.  
Putting on the new software didn't fix the issue, so I called Omron back and told them that I must have a faulty unit.  They told me that I had to send back the unit to their repair department and include a $5.00 money order for the expense of sending me back a new unit.  
So they are asking me to pay for both shipping, to and fro, to replace a unit I purchased one month ago.  That is an insult to injury.  Not only do they not acknowledge the down time of not having the unit, the inconvenience and time spent mailing the unit and going to the bank to get a money order, but they charge me $10.00 for postage.
That is bad customer service in my book!

The D-Link Hub H-7 is NOT compatible with the USB 2 Sandisk Cardreader. I bought the hub specifically to free up a USB 2 port on my CPU that I was using for the card reader. It took about an hour to straighten out the mess created by these two pieces of equipment.
This peripheral failed once again this morning. It was necessary to unplug and replug a USB 2 device in order to get it to work. The reviewer above is correct about power through-put. I cannot use it for my card reader which requires power or to recharge my iPod. I still have my old USB 1 hub. I won't toss it now. It may go back on line.
I'm also very suspicious of the authors of many of the rave reviews. Can they be D-Link distributor employees?
My comments are not suitable for this site. Sufficed to say - beware of the D-Link Hub. It doesn't work with everything. Returning the D-Link is more hassle than it's worth, I'll just toss it if it continues to fail, so the sale stands though the customer is not happy.

Exterior box and breadmaker package in perfect condition and sealed. When opened, the front was dented, the word Breadman was scatched and smeared and there were fingerprints on lid (underneath a loose plastic bag to make it appear new). Never had a bad experience like this with Amazon. Since this was purchased from our bridal registry, and had no paperwork inside, it seems there is nothing we can do.

What a mess! I've used Turbo Tax for 10 years+. I never really thought that it was a great product - but at least it worked and saved me a little time. This year - the install hung up saying it could not access my C drive. It attempted to back itself out of the install but then completely hung up my PC and I had to reboot. I tried to reinstall but it said that it was already installed. There was no "uninstall" procedure so I used Windows to remove the program. But it retained some footprint that still kept me from reinstalling.
I sent Intuit my problem. An offshore support person sent me a boilerplate response back - telling me to try all of the things that any person with basic computer knowledge would have already tried.
I short - I cannot go forward and I cannot go backwards with the installation - and Intuit's help is nonexistent. I am returning the product to Amazon. I had tried Tax Cut several years ago and found it pretty lame. Guess I'll try it again. After that? Back to my Excel spreadsheets I guess!

Electronically, this drive worked as promised and the price was competitive, but the mating of the plastic shell and the metal blade of the actual USB connector is poor. The brittle plastic cracked easily and early, not enduring anything less than ideal conditions. Given that USB ports are often in locations involving blind reaching to the back of computers, PCs are on the floor, and ports are often on the sides and backs of laptops with little room for clearance, I recommend selecting a USB drive made of sterner stuff.

It's fun for the first sixty minutes. It's goofy, it doesn't take itself too seriously, and I actually found myself enjoying it.
Then it's like Michael Bay comes back from his coffee break and goes, "WTF BITCH GTFO THIS IS MY MOVIE &gt;:(" and uses the remaining eighty minutes to make up for lost time.
Yes. The world's longest Hasbro commercial is two hours and twenty minutes long. Really.
Anyway, at that point, the already flimsy plot is thrown out the window, all character development ceases, and it turns into a movie about explosions and trying to make absurd computer graphics look good by moving the camera too fast for your eyes to focus. So you've got eighty minutes of tedious, blurry, pretty much non-stop combat that pauses just long enough for the plot to be sort of revived and resolved in the last five minutes of the movie.
This movie taught me that computer graphics artists, as a rule, try to compensate for the shiny, too-perfect fakeness by making their work too complex for the viewer to discern detail.
So "Transformers" gets five epic monologues out of ten.

Eclipse, the third book in Stephanie Meyer's Twilight series, finally solidifies the distinctly dangerous message that obsessive love is a thing divine.  By the end of the 600-page tome Bella Swan realizes that her inexplicable love for vampire boyfriend Edward Cullen is neither healthy nor rational, but she decides she simply can't live without it.  Meyer uses Emily Bronte's classic novel Wuthering Heights to justify her distasteful romance - Bella is Cathy Earnshaw, madly in love with wild and monstrous Heathcliff (not quite a vampire, but close!).  Bella and Edward quote dialogue from the novel to each other, obsessive lines spoken by deranged fictional lovers whose relationship leads to nothing but disaster for both of them.  Bronte kills off her heroine mid-way through Wuthering Heights, leaving Heathcliff alone to torment the remaining characters in his insane quest for vengeance.  By the end of the novel Bronte gives us a second generation of characters, Catherine Linton and Hareton Earnshaw, who are able to love each other realistically and thus achieve real happiness.  There is nothing noble or admirable about Cathy and Heathcliff, and there is little noble or admirable about Bella and Edward.
In Eclipse, Bella is "torn between two lovers" - vampire Edward and werewolf Jacob.  Of the two, Jacob is portrayed as the flesh-and-blood man who can offer Bella a real life, even if he is a werewolf. It's clear that had magic and monsters not been part of Bella's life, she would have been with Jacob - they are, as she herself agrees, "soul mates."  In fact, she admits that the only force that could trump a soul mate is "something so strong that it could not exist in a rational world." As Jacob says to Bella, "[Edward's] like a drug for you."  And it's absolutely true - Bella is addicted and there's nothing healthy, rational, or sane about it.  There's also something very unsettling about the hoards of young women who are finding themselves as addicted to these novels (and to Bella's romance with Edward) as Bella is herself.  This is NOT love!  It's a psychotic addiction.
I enjoyed Twilight and I liked parts of New Moon.  But I had a really, really hard time getting through Eclipse, mainly because I saw little growth in Bella's character and no real deepening of her incomprehensible relationship with Edward.  Meyer's message - that the ultimate love relationship defies reason and common sense - is dangerous, especially in books aimed at teenage girls.

Now I have never written a review before, but after reading this...well I guess you can call it a book...I had to write something. I loved Twilight, and like New Moon, and really enjoyed Eclipse. So instead of being smart and making my own ending, I went to the bookstore at 12:01 am to get the final chapter and see how it all played out. 
Instead, I was handed Breaking Dawn which after the first two hundred pages, I was convinced was a joke. I kept looking for the page somewhere in there that said 'gotcha, this isn't the real thing...come back and get the actual book.' Sadly, this didn't happen. I was just into the second part of the book where I was fighting the urge to give up and not even finish it. I didn't buy the book for Jacob's perspective, I wanted Bella's. But I stuck through just to see what Meyer was thinking...hoping should would reign in the insanity. The last part of the book had some (very few) echos of the other three books, but instead of getting to the point, she would drag out scenes for pages when it didn't need to be that way. I really had very high hopes for this book and I HOPE they do not make this one into a movie...I shudder at the thought. 
I originally planned on only giving one star but the 'third' book kind of saved itself from completely drowning. It still only gets two stars though. Save yourself the 20 bucks and make up your own ending. Trust me, it will turn out much better than this.

Videos created require 3ivx codec, which the installation program installs. If you want troublefree recording in order to playback videos only using Windows Media Player at your computer then this is a great gadget as the video quality is very very good.  If you want to use any other player then you probably will have sound issues. Same goes for moving the videos to devices designed to play videos - great picture, no sound. (And good luck with getting help for this from the 3ivx people.)
I have no use for videos with no sound and I returned it.

Let me preface this by saying I think Meyers had an EXTREMELY difficult task of wrapping up this series and making everyone happy at the same time.  I also still think she is a great writer!
(Spoilers below...read with caution)
The romance between Edward and Bella was lacking.. A LOT!  The connection Bella and Edward have, which is why I fell in love with the series at first, was missing.  The honeymoon was sad.  No romance...just harsh and cold.
Secondly, I understand Meyer's reason for making the intimate parts of the book more PG...but after the gruesome description of Renesmee's birth...I got to thinking, why is violence and gore so much more acceptable than sex?
Speaking of Renesmee and this is probably trivial...can't stand the name.  And why are we calling Jasper, Jazz??
The standoff with the Volturi in the end was long and dragged out and frankly boring.  Yes my darlings...hopefully this will come to an end, soon!  :)
To leave this on a good note...
The wedding was great.  I didn't mind that Jacob imprinted on Renesmee - this would make a great spin off for the series. Finally we got to see some romance between Bella and Edward at the end of the story...to little, too late.  I like the confidence Bella begins to gain after she becomes a vampire.

This review is from: Australia (DVD)
      
There is a reason why this movie wasn't nominated for many Oscars and those few were for technical items.  The first half is a sappy comedy and the second half an over-wrought mess.  Australia is a beautiful country but it seemed that many of the vistas were green screen and digitally generated.  Jackman might be a good Oscar telecast host but he will never will an Oscar himself.

The toaster is bad because it toasts one side more than the other, the slots are too shallow for most bread (even sideways) and too narrow for bagels (so basically it is only good for English muffins).
Also, right on cue after the 30 Amazon warranty expired, the egg poacher stopped working completely, so I'm SOL.
Very cheaply made, poor design, and poor execution.
Do yourself a favor and just toast your English muffins to your desired darkness while frying an egg in a pan or poaching it however you do it.  Instead of something that does both this product does neither.

I bought 2 of these for our computer and our son's new school laptop. While the drive hardware works fine and can be connected via USB or Firewire or e-sata, the software is unacceptable. 
On our XP machine, setup wasn't nearly as intuitive as it could be or should have been, but we did manage to get it installed and set to back up two "plans" which included files from both of our internal drives. After about 5 hours of backup, everything looked like it was working.
 
However, the software is supposed to work in the background and yield system resources to all other tasks. This is not really the case. Even though it ran minimized, it routinely used 30% of the CPU load, and seriously slowed the machine for all tasks. We have also had a number of hangs/lockups and have lost some setting files due to this software as well- the machine is much faster and more stable when the Memeo software isn't running. Additionally, its very active software, popping up an annoying notice box over the system tray basically constantly.  
We finally had to resort to installing the StartupCPL tool (this is a very useful freeware tool) to prevent it from automatically running at boot up, so we can just start it manually when we want the backup updated. However, it has now lost one of my backup plans (the backed up files are still on the my book, it just wont back up any file updates anymore). We followed the instructions to re-attach the inactive backup but it will no longer see it. 
We have written to WD a number of times and no useful info has been provided. At all. They did basically blame Memeo for the software and said I should look for updates from Memeo.
Now, I'm not sure if Id call this part worse or just as bad (or maybe a blessing in disguise)but the software will not even install on our son's vista premium 64 bit OS machine (even in admin mode). It blinks a few times, nothing happens, and then quits!
In my opinion, this software is unfit for use. August 2008

There is no doubt that the iPod touch is really really cool. It's an amazing little device...
...until you really try to use it. I naively assumed that it would work as a PDA: it has a calendar and contacts, right? After using one for a month, I'm getting rid of it. The cool factor is long since gone, and I realize that in many ways I liked my 1998 PalmPilot better than I like this thing. I have used Palms heavily for a decade.
Things that a 1998 PalmPilot could do better than an iPod touch:
o The iPod is unreliable. The most frustrating is that the date/time/time zone likes to reset itself randomly.
o There is no ToDo app, and none of the downloadable ones sync well with Outlook.
o The calendar has no search capability - indeed, there is no global search. This is a dealbreaker when you have (as I do) a calendar with a decade of information, and over a thousand contacts.
o The auto corrections were clearly not tested: words get trashed beyond all recognition. If you are looking at the keyboard typing and don't see that it has suggested something off the wall, you end up with text that's beyond useless: a typo you might recognize and work around. If you type a lot of acronyms, usability is terrible.
o There is no caps lock - one of these little things that makes life a little bit harder, esp if you use a lot of acronyms.
o No search. I know I said it already, but it's a big problem.
o Memos are not syncable with Outlook.
o No cut and paste
o No block delete
o No zooming of text in long calendar or contact notes: the text is forced to very small
o In long contact notes, the only way to see the text is to edit them.
o There is no usable calendar alarm. I had to use it a couple of times to realize that it does beep, just so softly that you can't hear it from a pocket.  Loud Palm alarms were incredibly useful as notifications of meetings and as a customizable alarm clock. (If I have a very early meeting two months from now, I can set a Palm as an alarm right now.)
o The phone #s in contacts can't understand nonstandard numbers. If a number is 123-456-7890 ext 321, the software will try to be clever by changing it to 1234567890321. Thanks.
The PDA apps Apple tries to cover with MobileMe. Don't bother. Friends have had the sync overwrite the wrong data, and backup is out of your hands. But for me it's a bad idea: I am never going to keep my calendar or contacts on a server I can't control, and that's true of many many people.
Over the course of the last month or two, I've asked people who use iPhones/iPod touches who used to use Palms what they use for todo lists, or how they do calendar searches. Answers include using using postits for todos, looking sheepish, and being resigned to not being able to do what they used to do.
Again, it was really cool for a couple of days. But I'm getting rid of it.

In this book, you find Bella &amp; Edward reunited. A well-deserved reunion for everything they went through in book 2. But the thrill quickly wears off as Bella turns inward in angst about  her feelings for Jacob. It got a little tiresome as she complained yet again why Jacob and Edward can't "just play nice". When the answer should be obvious! Bella's not dumb. So I was disappointed when it took her most of the book to figure it out. The book would have been more interesting written partially from Edward's perspective - his need to make it up to Bella for abandoning her in New Moon and his jealousy towards Jacob as he attempts again and again to move in on his girlfriend. 
But the biggest flaw of this book was the lack of plot. We know that Victoria is out there somewhere plotting her death, but that aspect of it was so overshadowed by Bella's mundane angst that left me wondering if Victoria gave up. She came through in the end, but underwhelmingly. Her schemes were predictable from the first quarter of the book and so was her ending. Also, the moral preachiness of no sex before marriage theme was more than irritating. This is a vampire fiction novel. Not a church sermon! I found it hard to believe that Edward would have held on to that trite human thinking when he's lived as a modern, all powerful vampire for the last 100 years. Quaint and silly human notions of morality would be the last thing he would be concerned about, I would think. Concerns for her safety would be the only thing on his mind, not some out-dated, narrow notion of right and wrong. 
But this book does have some redeeming qualities. I enjoyed the back-stories of Rosalie, Jasper and Sam. It pumped the much needed life into this book. Also, Edward's sacrafices for her throughout this book was really touching. I'm sure he did not enjoy watching his girlfriend sleep in someone else's arms as Jacob attempts to thaw her from hypothermia. We only got an inkling of Edward's displeasure at this, when it should have been a raging inferno worthy of 1000 suns! Held in check only by his wish to see Bella happy. 
This book's okay. I'll still read book 4 after this. But I thought it could have been better.

This review is from: Eclipse Special Edition (The Twilight Saga) (Hardcover)
      
I am going to read the 4th book in order to find out what happens but it is hard to really get in to a book when you can't stand the main character.  Can Bella be any more annoying and immature?  I think she should end up with Jacob because he is younger than her and therefore more at her maturity level.  Edward is miles ahead of her and frankly I find it very hard to believe that he is supposed to be so in love with her.  What's to love?  A selfish, whiny baby?  No way.

Why does this film annoy?  Hathaway is a typical "deglammed" Hollywood femme in search of self-esteem and an Oscar--chain smoke, sarcastic comments, hair slightly unkempt, tears.  
Film has too much yelling, whining, accusations, and faux soul-searching.  All done to annoying effect with a hand-held camera.  At its end you feel like you have watched a reality series or a 'very special' episode of Oprah.  
The only redeeming element is Debra Winger, playing a character not too far from Shirley MacLaine's Aurora in Winger's 1983 Terms of Endearment.  If she loves her daughters so much why leave the wedding first?  why come to the rehearsal dinner late? She seems to be a woman who will only give so much of herself as a mother and a wife to tragic results [revealed three-quarters of the way in the film].  Were there cut scenes with Winger?  She deserved an Oscar nom more than Hathaway.
Note to screenwriter:  how come you couldn't write a part for Lena Horne, your grandmother??

I really wanted this machine to work - nice design, good features, good price.
The first one I got had the little carafe cap broken.  Not a big deal, I emailed the company and they promised to send me another one.  About a week later, the unit simply stopped brewing.  I called the support line for troubleshooting and they told me to send the unit back for replacement.
I sent it back and Amazon shipped another one out promptly.  Everything was fine the first day, but when I picked up the carafe the next day, the bottom came right off in my hand exposing the innards of the seal mechanism for the thermos.  The spot welds all along the rim hadn't taken and the carafe literally came apart in my hands.
Again I called the company asking if this was normal.  Again they told me to return it and "give them one more chance".  So I tried to - like I say, I really wanted this machine to work.
Unfortunately the response I got from Amazon was:
"As it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread 
than we originally thought, we are not able to send another 
replacement."
Probably just as well, after going through 2 units in under 2 weeks, the chances of the third one lasting anywhere near as long as I'd want it to are about nil.
So you can roll the dice and perhaps get yourself a good one - I did it twice and unfortunately got 2 lemons in a row.  
Buyer beware.  
(I never did get the replacement cap from the first one.  When I called about that, the rep I spoke to told me that they get so many calls that it's impossible for them to follow up on each one to make sure it was resolved.  I can see why they're overwhelmed with support calls and it's even more disturbing that customer service lets things slip through the cracks like this...)
(about a month later)
I replaced this with a Braun KF600... the choice is obvious having had both machines: the Braun is simply a better designed and better constructed machine for about the same price.  Save yourself the hassle and buy it instead.  It takes up less counter space, has a gold cone filter instead of the ill-fitting #4 paper filters, there's no twist cap on the carafe to fight with...
To be fair, it doesn't have a timer.  Not a big deal for me.

it ended how we all new it should be - in a perfect world.  i'm just sad b/c this series had so much potential. bella never lost anything - no struggle for life, no one close dies.  it was a perfect world - a pathetic hooray. it was a hard book to get through, simply b/c i was so tired of bella's self-depreciating way of seeing herself and her annoying need to please everyone.  edward's obsession with keeping bella safe got old, and jake no longer seemed attractive in that "i am life" sort of way.  it all just felt very a childish, fairy tale book - which, if you read the ending, was exactly what it was supposed to be.

TurboTax Deluxe Federal + State 2007
I receive capital gains dividends and most of them are received in the last month of the year. Form 2210 is used to show how the uneven income was received during the year, and to avoid a penalty by showing the estimated payments were accurate. Turbo Tax Deluxe generated this form in previous years, but it does not do it this year. This is a crippled product designed to have you enter the information, and extort you to purchase a more expensive version of the software, or pay an even greater amount in penalty. I intend to request my purchase money back based upon their Maximum Refund Guarantee - by not filling out form 2210 you have to pay more tax. Do not purchase this product if you income is uneven during the year.

I've never used anything but an old fashioned ice cream maker before (using ice and rock salt), so I was thrilled when I saw an ice cream maker that was self contained. 
From what the box said, I had no idea I would have to freeze the bowl for 24 hours before even using it. Imagine buying a crock pot and then learning when you get home that you have to preheat the bowl in the oven for 2 hours? That's how I felt! 
I have very little freezer space, so I had to thaw out some important things just to make room for this. 
I tried using this ice cream maker twice. I do not like custard based ice creams at all--so I went with a family favorite recipe that uses a milk base but makes an awesome ice cream. They've always had success with using that recipe in their old fashioned ice cream maker, so I figured I would have success too. Wrong! 
I froze the bowl and refrigerated my ice cream mix for 24 hours before trying to make the ice cream. At 30 minutes into the process, all I had was a few ice crystals in the mix. I though maybe I should wait longer to let it harden up more, but as time went by the ice crystals melted again and it became complete liquid. 
So I am very dissapointed and now I have to make a trip to the store to return this.

I've been a n52 "padder" since the unit came out, and I love it. However, it leaves little the imagination as far as looks are concerned, and seeing as how I just purchased a Saitek X52 joystick, and a Logitech G15 gaming keyboard, with all their blue glowy goodness, decided to pick up the Pro Gamer Command to match my desktop.
And it looked great! However....
I decided to set up my pad with the software included, and since it was already installed with my Saitek X52 (all Saitek products use the same software to keymap) I immediately knew how to program the keys. The software found the Gamepad immediately, and after a few minutes to tweaking the keys, off I go to play Battlefield 2. Now mind you, the Pro Gamer Command has a few more keys than the n52. However, where you normally have the thumbpad, it is now replaced with an analog stick. Getting the software to recognize a simple UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT keys for gaming was as simple as....well, it wasn't that simple. You have to set the software to deadzones, etc. since the software sees the mini thumbstick as a joystick of sorts. The biggest problem with this gamepad however, is the "lag" of the keys. As a FPS gamer, and if you also play FPS games you'd understand, that fast keypresses are not uncommon. In Battlefield 2, switching from your Shock Paddles to your gun then going prone all in the spawn of 3 seconds happens all the time. And this is where the gamepad failed. Horribly. If you try to strafe left and hit prone, it'll happen as you want it to %70 of the time. You'll either go prone. Or you'll strafe. I even had the problem with moving forward, and going prone, that my guy would still be moving forward while prone even after I let the key go. I had to repress the forward key again to make it stop. And this is not user error folks. Say what you will, but I know how to use the software to set the keys up from using my X52 joystick (GREAT joystick btw). 
All in all, it looks great on the desk, and more than likely will play well with RTS games and the like, but for FPS games, stay away. Stick with the Nostromo n52 instead. It's cheaper to buy, and is rock solid.
It just doesn't look nice.

A company I work for bought this camera to be able to use in our  training division.  The idea was to get a camera that could take some good still pictures, good video footage, be small and compact, and easy to use.  We really liked the idea of no clunky video tapes since all the footage goes on a small SD card that you can pop in most any newer computer.  For the record I would consider myself an fairly advanced user of digital media and editing software. No genius for sure, but I've spent many hours in front of a screen editing pictures and video and puting together many training videos.  After using the camera for the past two months, many hundreds of pictures and several hours of video clips later, here is what I found.
The camera itself is awesome.  The still pictures it takes are great quality and it's about as simple to take pictures on as a regular digital still camera.  The video operation is similar to other video cameras and the quality of the video is stunning.  The quality and ease of use in capturing the media you want just can't be beat.  Anyone can operate this camera without any problems at all, regardless of your technical "know how".
Now for the reason I rated this camera so low...  Once you have that stunning video inside the camera, there is no simple, easy, user friendly way to get it back out onto something you can pop in your 2 year old DVD player and show the family.  The software that Canon packages with the camera to install on your computer is absolute junk.  It's software that is comparable to what you'd find in a Dollar Store somewhere.  The user interface is so poor that even advanced users will be pulling their hair out to get the thing to work what little features it has.  No problem you say (like I did), you'll just use one of the easy programs like Windows Movie Maker to make your video....Sorry, Movie Maker isn't able to work with the format of video that the camera records.  And that is the root of the problem.  The AVCHD format that the camera uses has very, very, very few programs that will work with it and they all cost a hundred bucks or more to buy.
So, in conclusion, from an average guy that is pretty tech savy...stay away from this camera and any like it that use some special wiz-bang format to record with (specifically like AVCHD).  The technology is good but the software to work with it still has a few years to go.  Go with a good quality Mini-DV camera that you can actually use to make videos on with your home computer....and you'll save pulling your hair out!

This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)
      
So, I didn't really know anything about this series except for the fact that it was about a vampire and human romance.  I don't even read very much so you would think an easy read like this would probably satisfy me.  Although I'm 29 years old, I tried to read this with the teenage audience in mind.  I actually didn't mind Bella so much in Twilight besides the excessive emphasis of how beautiful Edward was which got annoying at times.  However, I rationalized Bella's behavior in the first book because I realized that I acted similarly gushing over my first crush in highschool.  Anyways, Twilight was engaging and I thought Bella and Edward had chemistry.  
On the other hand, the flow was terrible in New Moon which made many events in the novel unbelievable for me.  Edward was just so emo for me...how his family just took off in the beginning seemed out of character for the Cullens.  I understood the reasons at the end of the novel but I felt that Meyers should have explored their personalities and the nature of vampires a bit further in the beginning (and cut down on the the big chunk of Bella's depression).  Later on in the novel, the Victoria-werewolves-Bella conflict gets suddenly pushed back just to be rushed into the Bella-vampires-Edward's suicide plot.  The entire last half of the book felt rushed and I didn't feel any climax like in Twilight.  There was horrible continuity.  It was as if Meyers finalized her brainstorming.  The writing got lazy, her writing style got worse towards the end.  
Edward's suicide attempt felt like a joke.  Even Edward's and Bella's chemistry felt phony at the end.  I also started to dislike Bella very much towards the end with the way she treated her father and Jacob.  After reading so much about Bella's "gaping hole" for the first 1/2 of the book, I was really hoping that Meyers would put a little more substance into her character such as go in more depth about her relationships with Charlie and Renee so that I would be able to forgive her a bit.  Yet, that didn't happen.  This novel was too straight forward, very shallow, and thus very disappointing for me.

I purchased this product because I liked the idea of being able to easily remove the leg pouch to change diapers. I purchased the small which is designed to fit 7 to 14 lbs. The first time I used it, I realized it did not fit my son.  Although he weighs 9 1/2 lbs., the wing stretched far past the velcro fastener. My husband and I watched him wiggle his arm free in 15 minutes.  I would suggest that you just purchase a regular receiving blanket.  Just make sure it is large enough (about 30x40) so that you have enough fabric to effectively wrap your baby.

I think I can summarize my opinion about the product as follows:  it's cute, but it's not a REAL ice cream maker.  If you want a real ice cream maker buy one that you can add salt and ice to until the job is done.  This product runs out of cooling power after about 25 minutes and at that point there is no way to fix it (perhaps if you purchased a second bowl, and transferred the mixture to it ...).  I have tried to make 5 batches of ice cream so far and the results have ranged from VERY SOFT soft serve to cold soup (and I did follow the special instructions:  bowl in the freezer for at least 24 hrs, ingredients refrigerated for at least 24 hrs, no alcohol until the last 2 minutes, etc, etc).  I suspect this product may make acceptable sorbet but I have yet to try it.  So the bottom line is if you will be happy with very small batches, planning ahead to be sure the bowl has been frozen for at least 24 hrs and the ingredients refrigerated for 24 hrs, no alcohol until the last moment, and a product that will need to be frozen for at least 2 more hours before it is solid (or close to it) then this may work for you.

I'm giving this product two stars because it arrived on time, and in good condition.  I think it would have worked well for a smaller cat, or a very small dog, like the one pictured in the product photo, but the description does promise to support more weight than that.  Unfortunately, weight is not the only issue to consider:  My cat is large at 20 lbs--not really fat, just a big breed--and the steps were very out of proportion to his natural stride.  I tried coaxing him up and down a few times, but it was clear that his legs and paws were too big for the scale of these steps.  In addition to the size of the steps, the plastic construction meant that the whole thing moved a little when my cat put his weight on it.  Cat's really don't like feeling unsteady ground beneath them, and this movement scared him.  I ended up buying a much more expensive carpeted, wood-construction ramp for the foot of our bed, and he has had no trouble using that.

This was a great product until most of my applications started to hung.
I thought it was because of OSX , so I reinstalled everything.
Same crap. I just unplugged everything from my computer, and everything worked great. Little by little, I plugged back all external HD I had, until it was the MyBook turn. Application hunging came back ! From my researches (thanks to the guys at #macosx@undernet.org channels), it looks like it is the enclosure of the HD. If you are going to use an external hard drive, you want to be sure that the enclosure will use OXFORD chips. Not like this one. GREAT HD, but not for OS X !

I really wanted to love this machine- it brews coffee SO fast- fast enough to make serving multiple cups no issue, the water temp is perfect, there are so many flavors I was excited about. 
But the coffee was WEAK. How can you afford to pay $150 and extra money for pods when the coffee isn't any good? Even the bold flavors! It's NOT a roast issue! You should be able to get a medium roasted coffee that's not the color of tea (even on the smallest size setting)- it reminds me of coffee from Denny's. And I'm really not a coffee snob either- my favorite brand is folgers. But this doesn't even come close to an avg. cup of folgers!

I just purchased this oven, and I'm very dissatisfied with how it makes toast. The top of the toast is done perfectly, but the bottom is not as toasted. The rack is in the right place, etc... but I notice visually that the elements on top get hotter/redder/brighter than the bottom. Is this normal? Does everyone who says it makes perfect toast have to turn the toast over? I'm trying to figure out if there's something wrong with my machine or if they all work this way. Cuisinart's customer service was completely unhelpful and kept just recommending I play with the toast darkness setting. Is my problem how this appliance works, or do I have a defective one?

Even if this series shows some interesting and beautiful scenes and animals, also thought that FINALLY we could avoid watching the violent 'mother nature' in action, at least for some time...didn't happen.
Personally would love to have FINALLY a DVD that shows the amazing beauty of this planet without the overrated, abundant violent and blood of the already overseen processes of nature inside videos.
So this is it; if you like that type of animal violence, blood and natural cruelty this is the one to get !
And if not, I recommend the IMAX series or the Buddha Bar DVD that will only show the positive aspect of it with even better shots and colors.
Already re-selling it in case you're interested !

OK.. well I was super hyped when I saw Gweneth Paltrow on Oprah and heard her talking about this workout. I have been a professional dancer for almost 30 years now so this seemed like it would be perfect for me... So I ordered both of the videos.. the Dance and the Matt workout. There is a lot of cool things about this video but more importantly, I think the Dance workout is dangerous. No wonder Gweneth threw her knee out.. although I'm not sure if it was from doing this workout but I think it would be very easy to get injured performing this class. It is a great challenge just to complete all of the dances in a row and follow Tracey but this kind of workout is better done in a class with a live instructor and mirrors where you can see all angles as well as a proper floating floor to help you withstand all the jumping and direction changes. Tracy's cueing is not great either and that can be very frustrating as well as her constant pouting into the camera. 
I am such a big fan of Karen Voight and The Method Pilates workouts with percise timing and cueing and a no nonsense aproach, that these workout DVD's left me very disappointed. 
You WILL work up a sweat and the matt workout is great but I think you could do a much more efficient work out in one hour (rather than 2 with Tracey)with the same results if not better with Karen Voights "Slim in 10" dvd workout... as well as prevent yourself from being injured!

This review is from: Tropic Thunder (DVD)
      
I thought this movie would be funny with Stiller, Black and Downey in it. I was very upset with paying $20 for this movie and being disgusted with it. Every other word out of anyone's mouth is a F-bomb, I guess they thought if they could cuss alot it would make the movie better. There were a VERY few moments where you may laugh, but the rest was not worth it. I dont know about most people, but watching Tom Cruise with a fake gut and bald head screaming and yelling at everyone on the screen and then trying to save his screen time by dancing at the end of the movie was HORRIBLE.
You need to rent this movie before purchasing it unless you are into crude humor.

When I first plugged the 512 Cruzer Micro into the front USB 2 port of my PC it locked my PC instantly.  No crash, blue screen, etc.  Just locked.   It worked ok on another PC.  I called SanDisk and they said the problem is power.  Some USB2 ports (including the one on the front of my PC connected directly to the motherboard) do not provide adequate power for the Cruzer Micro.  I've used several other thumbdrives (of lower capacity) without a problem with the same port.  Maybe it's the fancy blue LED that sucks the juice?  I have no idea.  I got an extension cable (which SanDisk warned me might not work!) and am using one of the rear USB2 ports, which works ok.
SLOW:  I haven't used any other large capacity USB2 thumbdrives, but from reviews of other drives it seems this one is slow when transferring large numbers of files. (500 files 200MB took about 18 minutes) -- that is writing the files to the drive.
It is also extraordinarily slow (10 minutes) to delete those files.
I called SanDisk and they recommended reformatting the drive when deleting large numbers of files.
That seems dumb to me (and I have other files I don't need to delete...)
Also the MP3 Companion is constructed like something you would buy for $5 (very flimsy plastic switches) and has a difficult interface.  It also doesn't work if you have a folder of non-mp3s on your Cruzer.
All that said -- The cruzer is small and solidly made.  It looks nice and basically functions if your USB2 port has enough power.

I was thrilled to purchase an ice cream maker that would make ice cream with the touch of a button.  However, after only a month of using the ice cream maker, following manufacturer instructions, the inner gel that is supposed to freeze solid to make the ice cream cold, ceased to freeze.  It could never freeze solidly.
I called to get a replacement bowl and was told that not only would I have to pay to ship the old bowl back, but I would also have to pay for them to ship me a replacement bowl.  This is absolutely ridiculous.
Considering the CSR explained to me that it was company policy, I guaranteed them I would never purchase a Cuisinart/Conair product again.  It is unfortunate, as I have often heard good things about their brand.

OMG What a terrible product from such a highly recommended company!  Every salesperson, every knowledgeable friend said Linksys (Cisco) was the best.  If that's the case, they really dropped the ball on this model (WRT160N V2).
It comes with a nice user-friendly set up CD, which I found out later was a waste of time because it didn't save my customizations; I still had to go into the massive configuration program to enter the same settings.  LELA?  EasyAdvisor??  Forget it; that program worked only when it felt like it.  Half the time it didn't even start; when it did and I managed to make necessary changes (important ones still sent me into that massive config program), it would just hang while refreshing...but it was pretty to look at while I waited.
I managed to get internet connectivity running for only a short while.  Then it became unreliable, then it went out altogether.  So naturally everyone assumed it was one faulty product.  I exchanged it, got an internet connectivity on the replacement but it failed not even five minutes into using it.  There isn't enough space for me to list all the different things I did to troubleshoot or the settings I was told to try, and I don't even remember how many times I reset, rebooted and power cycled everything.  I did get a stabler internet connection by using my own ideas on configuration settings but could never get file and printer sharing working on my own.  To sum it up, after 5 chat sessions and 3 calls to tech support, I got "call Microsoft".
The tech support was absolutely terrible.  One person didn't know basic networking concepts like file and printer sharing, another didn't understand hexadecimal digits, a couple of techs kept asking me the same questions over and over again, I had to ask a question repeatedly and never got an answer.... Oh yeah, the reason I had 3 calls to tech support instead of just 1 is because I was hung up on twice, and no one bothered trying to reconnect with me.
This has been such a terrible experience, I am returning this router and I'm not even going to replace it.  I'm going back to sneaker net!

First impression: Holy cow! this looks just like Quicken 2006...
Second Impression: Performance S_U_C_K_S on an Intel-based iMac.  Sure enough, a quick check reveals that it is still a PowerPC binary. C'mon guys, can't you get with the picture?  The product still lags WAY behind the Windows version, but you could at least make one that doesn't have to run in emulation.  I could buy VMware Fusion, a copy of Windows XP, and Quicken for Windows if I wanted that -- I'd end up with more functionality and probably better speed as well.
If this thing dies when I run budgeting tasks like every release of the 2006 version, I'm going through the roof!

I've had it with Quicken. From its bizarre copy protection schemes to the endless promotions of its own products within the program and some of the dumbest programming decisions around, such as downloading all transactions from a single financial institution into one account, even though you have separated them into multiple accounts. I don't need Quicken making these decisions for me.
  The endless selling is intrusive and annoying. You have to be very careful that you aren't initiating some process that won't end up having you cancel it later.
  Quicken's help file is ridiculous. It is incomplete or in many instances uses terms that are different than those used in the program itself. All too often the sketchy help file entries refer you to an equally poorly written and uninformative web entry - where Intuit attempts to sell you more of their products and services.
  Because they were first to market and did a passable job in their early years, Quicken dominates the market. But, in my opinion, for the past several years, Intuit has abused its own customer base. I'm tired of it, tired of the endless marketing promotions in the programs, tired of the lousy help, tired of the ridiculous inflexibility of the program. I'll be looking elsewhere in the future and leave these moneygrubbers behind.

Customer review from the Amazon Vine&amp;#8482; Program (What's this?)
      
An interesting little camera. It is small, about the size of a small remote control, has a fixed internal memory and recharges its internal battery only through a USB port.
The video quality is okay, but not great. My Canon A720 IS shoots MUCH better video, and more of it, depending on the memory card used. This camera is limited to only the internal memory, and records 60 minutes at 640x480, 30 fps in MPEG-4, (assuming the battery lasts). That should be pretty good video, depending on the flavor of MP-4 used (part 10 or h.264 is a very good codec, but it isn't stated that this uses h.264). The only place any such information is found is on the bottom of the box in very small print.
The camera has software built in to copy video to a  computer (Windows XP, Vista, or Mac OS X only). Manipulating it from there on is not well documented, and the software has to be loaded from the camera to your computer - not a good thing. There was very little documentation included, which is not acceptable for the price. Granted, this is a video camera for people for people who don't want to be bothered learning any details about the gadgets they use, but a true gadget lover wants to know things that just aren't included.  Their website is Flash only, and the most recent edition of Firefox couldn't load any useful information - another major strike against them.
I found the camera easy to use, but extremely limited. It has to be recharged by USB port, so you can never get far from another device (most likely a computer) to recharge the camera. You cannot expand or swap the memory or change the video quality, so it is pretty much a niche camera for keeping around the office or home to point and shoot odd little bits of video here and there, or for short trips away from a USB charger.
I can't see $180 for a camera with such limited capabilities. Personally, I would much rather deal with the larger A720 IS, and be able to shoot 8 megapixel stills as well as great video, have removable SD memory cards, and use AA size batteries, all for only $20 more. The difference in flexibility and usefulness for that $20 is pretty amazing, and casts a pretty big shadow over the Flip. The small size is about the only strong point (if you happen to think smaller is better), but with the need for USB power and limited memory, it would not be a good camera to carry around even though it is small enough to fit easily into a shirt pocket.
Also, the build quality is not great. The camera looks great, but the pop-out USB jack is kind of flimsy and oriented so the weight of the whole camera hangs off at an angle. You will probably want a USB extension cable. 
It just doesn't seem very well thought out. The buttons and "touch points" that operate the camera are pretty sensitive, and are easily bumped by accident when the camera is on. It is not comfortable to hold, and the beefy metal tripod mount seems way out of place on a little camera like this.
If your video shooting desires fit in with its limited functions, this camera might be useful, but it seems to me it is just an expensive, limited function toy. It comes in a very nice flip (aha!) top box with a soft cloth carry bag (all nicely coordinated by the marketing team). Would that as much thought had gone into the design/use of the actual camera as was spent on the packaging/marketing concept.

Within only a few days of my waterpik purchase, the pump motor failed.  The return went smoothly, and a replacement device was sent.  Unfortunately, after only 4 months of once-daily use, the device that holds the tip in place stopped working, thereby rendering the waterpik unusable and unfixable as far as I was concerned.  I hesitate to purchase another.

I will be brief.
The good part - compact, sleek, very portable and quite easy to work with.
The bad part - VERY VERY VERY primitive software that overwrites your sensitive data without warning leading to loss of important files in a way that they can't be recovered!!
If you are trying to synchronize your computer and the drive, and if you have created new files on computer that now should be copied over to the drive, Passport software starts overwriting files on your computer!!! I lost several GBs of sensitive emails, almost an years worth of communication that was extremely important. My coworkers started reporting similar experience and collectively we decided our corporate cannot afford the sloppy Passport software.
Final Take: Buy at your own risk

I have returned no less than 4 of these under warranty.  Every single replacement unit I've received has been DOA.  What good does the 5-year warranty do if Seagate won't send me a replacement that works?  I have given up on trying to get a replacement that actually works.  I spent over $30 on postage for warranty returns.  I ended up taking apart the most recent one they sent and put the hard drive in a case I bought on ebay for $12 and it worked fine.  There seems to be some major power management issues with the enclosures.  I will probably never buy a Seagate product again.  From now on, I will stick with what has worked for me in the past (Western Digital).

Really, don't waste your money on this router. I'm pretty familiar with networking technology and this router has been nothing but a headache, constantly disconnecting in the middle of streaming and then requring a complete reset in order to get back on line again -- 3 to 4 times a day! I corresponded with the company and tried everything they suggested, changing channels, reinstalling the firmware etc., but nothing helped.

I love gadgets and technology in general. I own several netbooks, some of which I have purchased through Amazon.com. 
That being said, if you wish to make a fashion statement, buys one of these. They look great!  The performance on the other hand is sub par at best.
The start up time is painfully slow.
The interface for conectabilty is cumbersome, slow, and rigid.
Worst of all. . . the text is nearly unreadable. I have great eyesight. But, I need binoculars to read the text on this thing.

Our dog wouldn't eat her food with Angel Eyes sprinkled on it.  There was no way to get her to eat anything with Angel Eyes so we assume it doesn't taste very good and now we have a nearly full bottle that we can't use.

If you want to spend good money on frustration, then this router is for you. It resets its SSID frequently and Cisco hasn't provided a firmware update in over 2 years. If you call linksys support you get to hear someone read you a script in broken English. Calling it Junk is being kind.

The bad one needs unplugged/replugged as it appears to lose power and all associated connections, wired/wireless.  It may go a day, week or hours, but it is a consistent PAIN.

My wife bought the HV30 for my birthday. I eagerly unpacked it, charged the battery, reviewed the instructions, setup the camera and fired away at my little pug scratching herself on the bed. I played it back in hi def on my TV, great picture and then the camera totally locked up with the red light on in all positions including off! I couldn't eject the tape, lens cover was stuck open, zippo.
Left it overnight, battery was drained, plugged it in and it magically worked again! Charged up the battery again and took a likely Academy Award winning video of a Dunkin Donuts coffee cup on my kitchen counter. The camera again locked up so it is now on it's way back to the Amazon with the tape of my pug and the Academy Award winning Dunkin Donuts cup still stuck in the camera. Requested full credit, don't want another one.

This book didn't have the same flow as the previous three and although good in it's own right it wasn't good for the series. After book three I SO wanted Bella to end up with Jake, for he was the guy that truly made her laugh and smile and gave her true happiness; he was her soul mate while Edward was more of an obsession - and a toxic one at that. Jake was also closer to Bella's age (I always considered Edward a bit of a letch, for while he was 17 physically, he was actually 100 ..... ewwww!) Instead the book has Bella &amp; Edward marrying right away and instead of a love story and a consummation of passions we get shades of Rosemary's baby. (Ewww again). I have to say that this book broke the charm of the series for me, for it cannot be unread. Call me disappointed. PS.. In fairness the end of the book was summed up nicely and imaginatively, just not the way I'd hoped.

I bought one of these as a present to myself, it was the christmas present from HELL!  First, I am an IT professional with 20 yeas of experience so I know what I am doing.
The one I ordered from Amazon worked great for about 20 hours, then quit receiving wireless traffic until it was powered off and back on.  This seems to be a known problem from all the reviews and forum posts I have read since buying this product.
LINKSYS technical support was just awful, the foreign techs didn't know anything about the product or networking.  I had several two just hang up on me, the tech support experience was enough by itself to not buy this product.  This is becoming a major problem with a lot of companies that offshore their tech support to India.
After seven calls with tech support, they finally gave me an approval for an RMA.  I had the RMA replacement shipped to me keeping the original one until I recieved it ( had to put it on my charge card and the price they wanted for it was $20 over the going rate).
When I got the second unit, it was worse than the first.  It would only support connection speeds of 12-14 Mbps and had tremendous trasmission errors.  Tested it for three days against the original purchase, neither was worth my time and trouble.  I shipped them both back and probably won't buy linksys products anymore.  I used to buy all linksys stuff but after this experience it is time to look at other companies.
I've had a Belkin wireless router configured as an access point for several days now and have not had any issues with it.  It was cheaper, had more functions, and is capable of 802.11n.
Save your money, read more bad reviews on this product here and chose wisely.  I still have at least four or five more calls I am anticipating to get credited properly and I am out shipping costs for the returns and several hours each I day I had the product.

I have 2 of these routers and both are junk. One the AP keeps failing if more than 2 wireless devices are connected too it, it causes the router to reboot. Contacted support for replacement and after 30-45 minute wait for support they had me reset it twice. and it still failed. They finally told me it was my laptop's that caused the problem. Funny because my laptops work everywhere else. The other after 3 months of working the AP log read  kernel: WLAN: MLME - Disconnecting (deauth) wireless client: ffffffffffff Reason 3 and that was the end of my use of any dlink product. I have use dlink for years and there products have worked great, I will no longer use there products. I am an outsource IT provider and I will no longer recommed or install any of there products.

If you wish to create a beach, this product works great.  It is far easier to buy litter that clumps, remove the cover (which confined the space and works well if you have a very small cat) and scoop out the clumps yourself.  This device is terrific at scattering litter through the rolling action over a wider surface that the cat does alone.  Surfs up!

This review contains spoilers. I'm very sorry to give this book such a low rating, because I enjoyed the previous three books, and loved The Host even more. Having greatly anticipated, then inhaled this 750-page book as quickly as I could, I was highly disappointed in the ending.
There were many things that I liked about the book, especially how the Edward/Jacob issue was resolved, but I had really hoped that something in the DNA would have happened between the wolves and the vampires to completely eradicate both traits and make everyone human. (Maybe this will happen in a future book if the Jacob-Renesmee DNA combines?) It seemed that there were clues leading up to this, then the ending was anticlimactic and flat, and it was all "happily ever after" forever. There's no happily ever after if you've defeated the volturi but you know they're angry and will eventually come after you again (and they know where you live).
I have a HUGE problem with the fact that while the Covens and a few of their friends are "vegetarians", they have more friends who do kill humans, whom they purposely gather to their home to witness for Renesmee to the Volturi. During the weeks they were preparing, their friends hunted many times, although they respected the Covens' wishes to stay outside of a 300-mile radius of the area so none of Bella's human friends and family would be murdered. While Bella says that thinking about this made her "uncomfortable" she was still willing to sacrifice many innocent human lives to save the life of HER daughter and HER immediate family. Any good mother I know would not willingly allow this.
It also really bugged me that even after she became a mother she said several times that if Edward died she would have to die also. Again, incredibly selfish to leave your child.
There were many creative and innovative aspects to this story but these moral issues really grated on me. I could see there could be room for another book in terms of the werewolf/human/vampire DNA issues but basically I can't see any moral value in being or associating with a human-killing vampire--if I were one (and we KNOW that it's possible for a vampire to be killed) and I knew I was a danger to humans, I would arrange for myself to be killed rather than harm anyone else.

This item arrived and it was not past it's due date... but it sure tasted like it was!  It did not taste like vanilla or almond.  It was more like a chalky, powdered whey flavor with a layer of goo on top.  The worst bar I have ever had. I've tried and enjoyed many bars, even the less palate-friendly high-protein ones.  Thumbs down to the vanilla almond!

Pretty bad,even considering the satirical comic book is essentially unfilmable. The idea of Howard in the completely phony looking duck suit was,to say the least,a bad idea. Something animated,along the lines of Roger Rabbit,or Mr. Limpit,would have worked better,but the script is horrendous in any case.
I only give this 2 stars since Lucas has done numerous movies which are even WORSE,for example,the last couple of Star Wars movies.Howard the Duck was a pretty strong signal that Lucas was just a hack.

These drives have no fan.  A proper external case should have a fan. However this makes them noisier so some manufacturers have sacrificed reliability for "quietness". That means that they heat up a great deal. This will shorten their lifespan and in some cases (as other reviews here have mentioned) the drive electronics or USB controller will burn up and fail.

My wife &amp; I got this as a wedding gift 3 years ago. My mother had this same mixer for over 25 years. We have always thought KitchenAid was the best brand you can buy. -Wrong! maybe 20 years ago. We use this mixer at most a couple times a month for light duties. After 3 years, the PTO on the front used for the attachments quit working. I was shocked to see it only had a 1 year warranty! It is because they make them cheap now, and probably in china. Like most US appliance companies, they are riding on their reputation in the past as a quality product, but make cheap garbage these days.

I bought this product after I moved to a bigger place and needed a Access Point to widen the signal range. After setting it up, I realized there were a few things I wasn't aware. 
1. The device must be physically connected to your existing router (so it's not totally 'wireless') to be used as Access Point. 
2. If you want the device to be completely wireless, it needs to be configured as Wireless Repeater. 
3. To use it as Wireless Repeater the model of the existing router you have must be WRT54G. (not WRT54GC, WRT54G2, WRT54GS, etc.) 
After spending hours on chatting with Linksys support (apparently she wasn't even aware some of these restrictions) we found out this device won't work with my router so I decided to return it.

Wow, what can I say, once you go HD you'll never go back. Great camcorder from an ergonomic perspective and I mirror much of what others have said but I'm going to focus on a few things others have not yet said...mainly that I'm a MacPro user and yes indeed the SW to play &amp; edit isn't included for Mac OS but it is for Windows.  You'll have to buy something like iLife ($79.95 on Amazon) to play your video (if you bought your mac recently it has iLife on it for free) on your computer and then edit it.  How crazy is that?  Free for Win, but $80 for Mac!   The bigger issue is that I can't seem to find an answer to what I think would be part of a normal workflow.  That is, I want to simply use my Mac to archive my .mts (ACVHD) files and then bring them back (unedited) to the camera so I can view them on my HD TV via the HDMI cable.  YOU CANT DO THIS!  I spoke with Canon support and they said and I quote "We claim no compatibility with Macs WHATSOEVER" but the Pixma software included does allow you to download to WIndows, play and move it back to the camcorder".  The only way to view a clip if  you have a Mac is to burn the archived video on to DVD and then view it.  HOW CRAZY is that!?  My kids just want to occasionally view an old video now and then and what faster way than to simply copy the particular clip back to the camera temporarily to view?  NO, you have to burn a DVD!  Per Canon support "copying from a Mac is meant to be a ONE-WAY process".
If you use Windows, I'd say it worth buying.  If you use a Mac, WAIT!!  Shame on Canon for not recognizing an important user base when releasing a THIRD generation ACVHD camcorder!

I have used the Omega Paw for about 3 months.  I am now throwing it away.  Here is why:
1)just like a traditional litter box, urine can get caught and solidified in the corners.  The Omega Paw makes this worse because it can get gummed up against the grating fins.  That means you have to take the whole thing apart. 
2)The box and fins get progressively disgusting as waste builds up.
3)partially dried urine gets gummed up in the track that holds the fins
4)it gets points off for daring to call itself a self-cleaning litter box.   You still have to maintain it just as much as any traditional box.
Pros: You can be more lazy about cleaning the thing.  Using its rolling action, you can avoid most hand-scooping.
Cons: the above mentioned congealed urine in the fins problem.
I tried 2 kinds of litter: Arm and Hammer (which controlled odor well, but liked to congeal) and Cat Atract (which didnt congeal as much but stank quickly).
So I rank this 2 stars because I would not get it again or suggest it to someone else.

First, you should know that Open Office from Sun Microsystems blows away MS Works and is absolutely free.
Second, Works still has features that it can't support. For example, it has greeting card templates, but does not have features like "rotate" that are absolutely necessary if you're going to make a greeting card!
In fact, Works is sadly lacking in features. It looks fancy, but its functionality is very poor.

A couple of years ago I purchased the Zoji BBCCX20 because it appeared to be highly rated.  It was the worst breadmachine I ever purchased and a waste of money.  The loaves come out uneven, higher on one end than the other, and the top of the crust is lighter and thiner than the sides and bottom. I only use this machine for making dough, then, I finish the bread in the oven.
  I've written the company a couple of times and received some general information on what to change but nothing I do seems to produce a good quality loaf of bread.  Did I just get a bad machine? Maybe, but I'm certainly not going to spend the money to get another Zoji to see if a new one would be any better. I have a little machine that I bought years ago at Williams &amp; Sonoma that makes much better bread than the Zoji.

This review is from: Howard the Duck (VHS Tape)
      
You see folks, when this movie came out I was a kid so naturally being in my mid twenties now I wanted to have another look at it. I was shopping a few weeks ago and picked it up in a bargain bin at a local shopping center. I got home and watched it. It was more horrible than I remembered. I suddenly remembered that I didn't enjoy it when it came out. The duck is so annoying you want to roast him and drizzle red-wine sauce over his corpse and chow down. Lea Thompson is a pretty good actress but this is no star vehicle for her. Jeff Jones is the only good cast member and that only happens after he turns into a demon from outer space. The only sequence I liked was the one in the diner when Jeff Jones freaks out. The rest is pretty bad. Zero folks. But Amazon does not have that star system. They need to for movies like this!HOWARD THE DUCKCOST ME FIVE BUCKSAND I THOUGHTWITH A LITTLE LUCKTHAT I MIGHT ENJOYHOWARD THE DUCKTHAT DIDN'T HAPPENSO HOWARD THE DUCKFLEW FAR AWAY FROM THIS SCHMUCKWHO WASTED HIS FIVE BUCKSON HOWARD THE DUCK

It took FOUR DAYS to do a virus scan (yes, I do have 800gb of storage).  And it did find a Trojan!  Thank goodness.  But, it would not tell me which file it was in.  No way to get the filename.
I bought it for backup (since they took away the fair but functional backup that came with XP).  There is no treeview checklist for backup, no way to exclude or include entire directories.  Instead you get to say things like "Financial Files".  I have files named .XYZ what does it think those are?  
After I courrpted a few files I thought I would try out the restore function.  "Enter Filename".  Huh?  I want to restore a whole subdirectory, and I dont recall the fargin filenames cuz the files are gone now.  Again, no treeview checklist for restore.  But you can view the list of all files sorted by name.  Remember I have 800gb, that was a joy.
This may be nice for grandma, but not for me.  Give me back the old "free" backup that came with XP and I'm happy.

All this thing is is a poorly made Dremel or Rotary Tool. Long and short, my Cuz bought one and I witnessed him tormenting his pooch with this thing.He gave up after 10 minutes of  watching and listening to his Lab shivering and growling and this thing only removed a couple of 1/16th's from one nail in that ten minutes.It is to underpowered to be of any real use. Can I just recommend the easy and professional way. Get a good Canine Nail trimmer, one made in the USA or Germany and then pick up a inexpensive rotary tool with a small drum sander tip . Cut the bulk of the nail off with the mechanical trimmer and then simply use the rotary tool to round and smooth the nails.I have English Bulldogs and have been using this system for ever. If your Dog has Black or dark colored Nails simply get a very strong mini flash light and hold it against the claw to see were the Quick is. I have used this simple technique for over eight years on two English Bulls and have only drawn Blood on two occasions and those two times were my own Mea Culpa .And if it does happen ,a dab of Styptic powder  and all is well.Just use a fine grit  and a lower speed on the rotary tool, so that very little heat will be produced and don't apply much downward pressure.Your going to find that your dogs claws have never looked and felt so smooth, no more carpet snags or scratched legs and arms.Don't fall for this companys, if you try and clip your animals claws without there wonder Gizmo , it is tantamount to torture malarkey This thing is a cheaply made rip off product that will make your Canine hate nail trimming time. As far as Felines ( yeeeeck) I cant tell you.Oh, by the way if you are looking for a good grooming tool that really works try the Furminator. Yeah I know, nothing to do with claws or there trimming !

This review is from: Tropic Thunder (DVD)
      
I had read review after review which hailed Tropic Thunder, but shortly before seeing it, a friend who has similar taste, said she literally fell asleep during it. Two extreme points of view that had me wondering which side of the opinion aisle I was going to stand on. Consider the two stars my answer. This movie was hugely disappointing. Critics seemed to love it because it skewers Hollywood, another of those insider movies that, for me, are far more smarmy and self-congratulatory than they are funny or memorable. Mel Brooks has always done this kind of thing well but Ben Stiller is not Mel Brooks and Tropic Thunder isn't even in the same ballpark as Blazing Saddles or even Silent Movie. The problem is that they spend so much time ripping on each other in some glorious back-stabbing fest that they forget about the rest of us who neither care about studio moguls, agents, or bloated celebrities nor find them people who are interesting, at least I don't. Whether Tom Cruise plays a great studio exec or Matthew McConaughey pulls off the loyal agent to Stiller's Tugg character are considerations that have no interest to me. None of the characters is that interesting and it is hard to care about the vanities of actors or the Hollywood pecking orders therein. There are no really funny jokes, the plot is ridiculous, the gags get tired very early on, and the best part of the movie is the opening pseudo-trailers. You know a movie misses the mark when the best it can do with Jack Black is reduce him to a smack-addicted Hollywood clich� going through withdrawals in the jungle. Hilarious! I'm sure Robert Downey, Jr. found much to laugh about in art imitating life, but I sure didn't. This movie is as predictable as it is dull: Stiller is an aging action hero who believes his own hype, Downey, Jr. is a method actor who spends so much time getting into other characters that he has none of his own, the gangsta rapper-turned-actor turns out to be a closeted homosexual, and the one untainted guy, the nerdy na�ve newbie played by Jay Baruchel is the lone touchstone the rest of us are supposed to identify with. And yet, he worships the very people who are so unappealing to me! Everyone is a phony, brown nosed, spoiled, selfish brat in this movie. Why would I care what happens to any of them? Whether this movie is accurate in how it sends-up movie making and all the boorish people involved is beside the point. I simply don't care at all about that E! garbage and watching a two-hour movie that had all the thrill of being the outsider at a work party was a huge waste of time. The only thing I do care about is my entertainment dollar and Tropic Thunder isn't worth the money I spent to watch it.

The Seagate software is too complex for the average user. I find it difficult to assess which files are even on the drive. Furthermore, the software doesn't seem to save my back-up plans. So, when I manually initiate a back-up, it seems the drive back-ups up duplicate versions of my files.

I thought this would be the perfect solution for a 59" doorway with no molding in my game room.  It was very easy to put together at the smallest width and, based on a few tests that I performed, the tension seemed good and relatively easy to work with at that width.
However, when I expanded the gate to full capacity (instructions tell you that it should be at least 1/2 inch wider than doorway)the gate became very difficult to manipulate.  I don't know if it was me or if the gate was defective, but regardless of how much I adjusted the length of the top and bottom bars I could not get them even and the gate was significantly lopsided/warped.  Also, the longer I made the gate, the less flexible it became for compression to fit into the doorway.  It took about 30 minutes before I could finally get it in with a good fit - and then it was still lopsided.
It was very strong when in place - my 11 month old attempted to climb it and it showed no signs of budging.  However, when I tried (again) to fix the lopsided-ness, the gate popped loose leaving indentions in the drywall where it had been mounted.  I returned this to the store the next day.

I am running Office 2003 on a XP machine and bought Office 2008 for the Mac and hoped to be able to move the Outlook information from the PC to the Mac. I found out that Microsoft has disabled functionality for exporting from Outlook that was present in earlier versions of Office, and at the same time dropped Outlook in the Mac and provided an application called Entourage. Well Entourage cannot import data from Outlook .pst files.
One can upload all their contact and calendar information to Plaxo over the  Internet and put all their private information onto a server that is who knows where and who knows who will be able to access the data. Plaxo states that they actively mine the data that is uploaded to their servers. 
So if someone is planning to use the Mac and thinks that by buying Microsoft Office for this platform they will have an easier time porting data than if they used 3rd party apps instead they will be disappointed.

I just returned my copy of TaxCut. Good thing they have a 60 day refund policy.
When I saved my returns to an Adobe PDF file (see review below about the shareware utility they use), all of the worksheets were unreadable. The width of the worksheet content seemed to be set for about half the page width, which caused page overflow. Margins at the top cut off content. Not at all usable. The IRS forms were fine, so it's not me.
I'm using a wide-screen display, maybe they took the display size and scaled it. Don't know. Don't care. I have a problem and have no way to fix it. TaxCut needs to test their software better. Back to TurboTax.
========== Earlier review=======================
Everything was going OK until I tried to print the return to a PDF file. Without my permission or knowledge, TaxCut installed a program called "pdf995". It's used to create PDF files. If you don't print to PDF files, the software is not installed.
Run the separate program, installed as Software995 in your Program list. There are ads. There are IE windows with ads - it launches IE without my permission.
The add/remove programs lists it as "Pdf995 (Installed by Tax Cut)". Like that makes it OK. It's not even a licensed version, it's the shareware version. They should have just installed the driver and left the software out.
This little gem is going to reinstall itself if I run TaxCut and check for updates, without me knowing about it. I'll also have to manually uninstall it after I'm done with TaxCut.
To be clear, this is not spyware or a virus. The correct term is "crapware" (stuff installed without your permission that does nothing but sell you products).

Remember that time that your high school boyfriend left you and you became despondent and started doing crazy things to hallucinate his voice in your head? No? That's probably because you're a sane person with a healthy identity that is separate from your high school boyfriend's. Bella is not sane. Bella is completely out of her gourd in this book, and we get to see exactly how unhealthily obsessed with Edward she is.
I know that fiction is just that: fiction. I also realize that not all characters need to be likable or even have an iota of common sense. What bothers me about the Twilight books is that Ms. Meyer has created a world in which teenage hormones run free, completely unchecked by common sense, parents, or even reality. If I had a teenage daughter who slipped past the brink of sanity over a breakup with a boy she knew less than a year, I would be trying to rectify the situation. In Bella's world, her love (which is a sacred, pure, overwhelming love, the author assures us again and again) was so important that it's okay for her to just throw her entire life down the drain once Edward leaves her. School activities? Friends? Academics? None of it's important now that she doesn't have her man by her side (not that it was really that important to begin with; who could focus on being a strong and independent woman when there's a total hunk around?).
It's one think to suspend reality to prove a point or create an engaging world. However, suspending reality to let me read about a teenager who believes in soulmates is absurd.

I love the space for the price of this hard drive but did not have a very good experience owning it. The backup software is totally useless - it's better just to copy/paste whatever you need backing up. The software took literally days to back up. THEN it suddenly refused to mount on any computer less than a year after I bought it. Yes, it was still under warranty but I lost some valuable and sentimental data.

I would like to warn those who would like to buy this collar.  I bought the collar brand new, and was warned by others about the longevity of the battery.  I wanted to prove the reviewers wrong.. but guess what, I was the one who came out as a loser.  I lost over $40 dollars on this collar.  THE REASON:  The battery didn't even last for 2 days.  The battery went dead the following day.  The battery is exclusively made by Petsafe, so you will have to buy the battery at the store, well I am not going to bother to buy another battery which will just last for a day, and costs $10 each.  I now understand why others who have bought this same collar have bought 10 batteries along with the purchase of it.  I feel so cheated and disappointed by this product.  I hope Petsafe will make changes quick to this collar.  I'd hate to say it but its basically a r i p off.

2 days after I ordered this from Amazon, they dropped the price five dollars. I called them up for a price differential credit, which was refused by 2 customer service reps and their supervisors. They said that on September 1, 2008, Amazon had eliminated their 30 day price differential credit policy. When I asked where I could find this change detailed on their site (they have had this policy since Amazon opened), they said it wasn't there.
I wrote to Jeff Bezos. His assistant replied to me, and politely refused the $5 refund. I asked where the updated policy could be found, and was told that since there was no longer such a policy, no mention of it can be found on their website.
I suggest you buy this product from a merchant who is both more upfront about their policies, and more concerned with customer satisfaction, which sadly at one time would have been Amazon.

I have two yappy pomeranian dogs.  The larger one periodically wears the Premier Gentle Spray Anti-Bark Dog Collar (available from Amazon for approx $45).  It works wonderfully but it's only recommended for dogs over 6 lbs.  So I bought the Lentek to control barking in the smaller dog.  
I've had it for two months now and still use it, but it only works minimally.  The dogs sometimes pause a bit when it's triggered, but most of the time they just continue barking.  
I guess the Lentek's better than nothing, but I wouldn't buy it again.  Instead, if your dog is over 6 lbs, I would buy the citronella collar.

I got the USA-19HS thinking it would be good to support a company that releases it's products with linux drivers.  Well, what a disappointment this was, even though there is a picture of Tux on the box along with the Windows and Mac icons this model is not supported in Linux.  I emailed Keyspan support and got an auto-repsonder that said they'll get back to me within 72 hours.  It's been 4 days and still no response from them.  Luckily this thing worked pretty well in OS X so I sold it to a friend of mine and bought myself another USB serial adapter, a keyspan USA-19, which is an older model with good Linux support.  Although I replaced this purchase with another one of Keyspan's products I wouldn't support this company in the future and won't recommend them to anyone else.

The first flip I got was defective.  Something was wrong with the screen and it stopped filming after 5 short videos.  I also had a lot of trouble downloading the pictures, so I returned it, thinking it was just a bad apple.  I got a replacement and thought everything was fine because it was filming well.  However, once I tried to download the videos, again, I could not save them.  It would say save error.  Nor could I email any of the videos.  I'm very disappointed and am definitely returning the camera for good.  Its small size and ease of use were nice and convenient, but it gave me so much headache as I try to download the photos that it is just a huge disappointment.  Last night it took me all night to try to save all the photos - what a waste of my time and a frustrating experience.

I have ordered an external hard drive through Amazon.com; the seller is BuyNow.  I never received the drive. BuyNOw asked me to contact FEDEX. I contacted FEDEX and they asked me to submit a claim. I submitted an online claim together with a proof of purchase.  After some time FEDEX wrote to me that as a result of an agreement between FEDEX and Ingram Micro all claims must be submitted by the later. So I called Ingram Customer Service and they told me that BuyNow has to contact Ingram to arrange for an Ingram account number and a reference/claimant number to settle this matter.  
I am extremely disappointed of how much time a simple order for an external hard drive is taking and for waisting so much time for a product I don't have but I have already payed for.

This DVD is irresponsible in that it implies one can heal one's cancer, vision problems (even blindness) by just not focusing on the negative and thinking about the positive. While I'm all for the power of positive thinking and believe it can be helpful, it is completely irresponsible to imply that that is all one might need medically.
There really is no secret and after watching this expensive DVD, I felt taken for a ride. All they are really saying is that the universe gives you what you spend the most time thinking about and it doesn't know the difference between something that might be negative and something that is positive. So, if you spend a lot of time dwelling on and thinking about the negative things that you fear, that is what you will get in life. If on the ther hand you spend a lot of time concentrating on the positive, that is what the universe will give you because you would have spent more time focusing on the positive (ie. it's all just about the power of suggestion).
You do not need to spend the money on this product to learn this. The secret is that there is no 'secret'. It's all hype to try to get you to spend your hard earned money on this expensive product, which by the way they state will be an entire ongoing series.

They should have a quick guide, two-page booklet summarizing how to set the unit. I had to read the brochure twice before being able to use it.  At first I was using the single test mode and for some reason it reset by itself to the Tru-Test mode which takes 3 readings within 3 minutes span and gives you an average. I had to go back to the booklet to reset it to the single test mode.  I used to have a manual inflate bp monitor and I never had trouble with it.  This one gives too  many error messages related to the cuff.  I don't like the fact the cuff doesn't lie flat. Next time I buy something from Amazon, I am going to read the one and two star reviews instead of the 4 and 5 star ones.

<review id="669" label="0">
The product is great. But I am only giving one star because if you purchase through Amazon.com, the lifetime warranty is void. Meaning, if your product stops working, Farouk will not replace it. 
I would suggest buying it from Ulta or some other store like that. It may be more expensive, but at least you have that warranty. 
The risk is yours.

Maybe I'm asking too much for a $250 product, but I feel a little misled.  In addition to the MiniDVD record capability it has a flash memory where you can take video and pictures too.  The product came out this year, so I thought I could use a couple larger flash memory cards and mainly record video that route.  Once I get this, I learn it only takes 2GB cards (no SDHC).  So I buy 4 2GB cards and a 3pack of MiniDVDs, figuring I'd just use flash memory and that would be easy enough for most of my recording.  The first time I put in an SD card and see that the screen switches from 16:9 to 4:3 on me.  I discover that it only records 4:3 on SD.  And I learn that it records in MPEG4 for SD memory (versus MPEG2 on the DVDs).  I understand their MPEG4 has proprietary codecs, etc.  I tried importing video into Sony Vegas, but found it would not read the format off of the MiniDVD.  I tried re-ripping the DVD using DVD Decrypter, but that still did not work as once I dragged the video file into Vegas, I got only video (no audio).  Also, in general I found the use of the MiniDVD's on this Samsung to be not very attractive.  Like many users, I pause when recording.  When viewing the recorded DVD, each pause at the end of a segment would show as a frozen image for 2-3 seconds before moving to the next scene, which is very annoying compared to using tapes to record to.  Thanks to Amazon's generous return policy, I'm not at a loss.  Am seriously considering going the High Def route, as it seems many of those products have less problems (based on reviews here) for someone like me who wants to be able to do some editing of the video I shoot.

I bought this camera to use in our business, mainly to produce high quality videos for use on our website and some youtube videos, as well. I realize I didn't have to have HD, but the camera was rated really well, so I sprung for it. The problem with most of the reviews I read is that almost none of them talked in depth about how to edit these videos. Essentially, you can't edit them in Windows Movie Maker and many of the well known video editing software. There are a few programs you can, but the video is so choppy that you can't effectively edit it anyways. You ca use VoltaicHD to convert it to avi or wmv then use common programs, but it's coverted and worse quality, which defeats the purpose of editing hd video for high quality purposes. To me, AVCHD is only worth a darn if you have a supercomputer with an expensive software program to edit it, and even then, it's not worth the hassle at this point, to me. So, I returned it, and bought the non-hd version of the same video camera instead, which I'll be trying out tomorrow. I'll let you know on the difference.

Bought this because of the top rating in Consumer Reports.Making and pouring coffee was great.  However I sent the first one back because the clock would go berzerk after a day or two and therefore the auto brew would not come on when it should. We woke up to cold coffee that was made in the middle of the night. When the clock changed you couldn't reset it because it would go from 1:00 to 19:00 (rather that 1:00 to 12:00 AM/PM as when first plugged in), almost like a timer. We had to unplug the coffeemaker for 30 seconds to get the clock to reset only to have the same thing happen in a day or two. Sent it back for a replacement and the new one did the same thing. Maybe our kitchen TV or Laptop was causing interference because they were close to it. Either way it didn't work for us. We sent the second one back for a refund and bought another Braun, just like the one we were replacing in the first place.

What a mistake! I have recently purchased what I thought was an upgrade for Dragon NaturallySpeaking Preferred 9.0 by responding directly to an upgrade announcement.  What I received was a mess in the form of Dragon Preferred 10.
The company shipped software with a fatal flaw. The software would not load directly from the CD. Nuance knew this, but shipped anyway. 
They compounded the problem by making it very difficult to find out how to make the program work. Could have included instructions, but NO! Instead offered interesting alternatives: I could pay to talk to a tech service rep or I could pay to send an e-mail. Oh, but I can only send you an e-mail if I go through multiple steps of creating "a user ID." 
They must be kidding! This bears no resemblance to customer service.
By spending significant time on their website, I finally found the buried instructions on how to bootleg the software. In fact they had to post two alternative in case their first "fix" didn't work! If I would copy the disc to my hard drive, I could work around the error of the software writers. Unfortunately this led to a new problem: either by design or on purpose the software could not recognize that it was an up-grade. As a result it deleted all my Dragon 9.0 files as a part of the installation process... including my user files. I'm sure you can imagine how delighted I was to spend time retraining the software.

I bought this tug toy because of the reviews...However, none of my three dogs had any interest in them, even when I put their favorite snacks in them. I dog is a big chewer, one is a medium chewer, and one is too old to chew! Not one would go near it...Also, it does not look like the picture. It is entirely in purple, and the tug is all purple and rubber... This is the only toy I ever bought that all three dogs disliked. It has been a week, and I keep giving them the toys, but no luck.   I personally think it is too awkward and heavy..Fell on my bare foot, and it hurt somewhat.  I think you could make this with a plastic soda bottle, for nothing...

I've read the reviews, almost all of them. Few of them seem to have anything to do with the writing, directing or production.
They seem to be pointed at plots that suit a predilection. 
Even mine, come to think of it. My predilection being for reason and relationships.
The third season reaches for thought and nobility, though the first two did also. The third season rises above producers' "war and sex", without abandoning the importance of either. 
The questions raised in the third season are exquisite. Painful. And important. The single thing this series does magnificently is raise questions. Even early on. 
I count the third season as the very best, but acknowledge my dislike of war and sexual violence (humiliation) may be biasing me.
The writing has been supurb throughout.
Though I also notice: Joss Whedon made us laugh at ourselves.
BSG doesn't.

If you buy this product you better pray it works.  I purchased this product and it didn't work, sent it back to Amazon to get replaced.  Then it still didn't work.You might think that it was my setup but tech support has confirmed that it wasn't, and that this is the 2nd 'faulty' switch.  However they have failed to send me an RMA number to send it back to them.  I have called every day for the past 2 weeks to try and obtain this elusive 'RMA confirmation email'.As of right now their tech support/customer service 800 number isn't even working or is overloaded.If you buy this product, I hope it works for you.

These diapers are the worst! I thought after all of the great reviews that these would be great. They leak terribly!! I mean a paper towel would hold more liquid than these! I ended up going with cloth diapers in the end but before I switched I tried these and was extremely dissappointed - I bought a case of them and ended up giving away 2 packs. What a waste of money. I had to change the baby every 30 min to an hour or he would be soaked clothes and all. I used what I had opened but to be "green" they caused more landfill material because you have to use 3 times more diapers than even cheap store brands. The only thing I did like abt these was the chlorine free and loved the color of the diapers but cloth Indian cotton is the way to go - cheaper in the long run and hold a lot more liquid!

Just as another reviewer has commented, there is a problem here for Mac users. MacBook Pro laptops have  USB ports on each side. I have successfully used an older silver IOMEGA external drive for almost a year -- thanks to the cable that came with that drive. The cable has the two USB plugs on long extensions, which allow you to plug in both on either side of the machine. 
But this hard drive arrived with a stupid USB cable that has the two USB plugs closely tied together. Upshot is that MacBook Pro users cannot use the cable. 
When I called IOMEGA concerning this, they first told me they would send me to tech support for $25. No, I don't think so. Then, I told them that my older IOMEGA drive worked fine. Why couldn't I simply get another cable like that one?
The response I got was that they didn't have any more cables like that. (Personally I don't think this is true.) The customer support person told me that I  would have to go purchase a USB adapter. (These run about $20)
Bottomline? Don't buy this drive if you own a laptop that has USB ports on each side of the machine. The cable won't work that comes with the drive, and I think it's crappy that IOMEGA then tells me, "Oh, we can't help you. Go buy a USB adapter."
Gave them a second chance with my silver drive. But there is no excuse for this. Bye bye Iomega.

This should have been a very simple purchase of replacement parts.  However, Braun has seen fit to redesign the screen pattern on the foil.  This provided a noticeably less close shave in combination with the new cutter block as soon as I used it.  I put the old foil back on (but kept the new cutter block), and the closeness of the shaver improved immediately.
So, looks like I'm using the old foil until it gives up the ghost.

After owning a couple of Sportlines that were usually inaccurate, and reading all the reviews about the Omron, I bought it hoping it would be The One. Turns out it's sorta OK. For one thing, it's larger than I expected, about the size of a small cell phone. If you look at other Omron products in the drug store, you'll see they use the same "cabinet" for most of their medical monitors, so it was not designed as a pedometer. Some reviewers said they could pop it in their pocket and they were all set. But it's too bulky for a shirt pocket, and any pocket below the waist -- other than a coin pocket -- gives a highly exaggerated reading. It's also more vertical than horizontal, so if you clip it to your waist it looks like a cell phone, which isn't too bad unless you already have a cell phone. Just like the Sportlines, you pretty much have to put it on a "sweet spot" near the front of one hip or the other, or in the coin pocket of your pants if you happen to have one. It is more generous than the Sportlines about where you can place it on your belt. Unlike others that can fold down so you can read them without taking them off, the Omron has to be slipped out of its holder, or you have to leave it in its holder and take it off. If you get a really good grip on it, you find out the reset button is pretty sensitive, and your day's results are wiped out.
 So instead of having a pedometer I can live with seven days a week, I only use it on Saturdays, because it's too much to lug around on the job. 
I'll keep it until I get some mileage out of it, and because I'm tired of shopping. But I won't recommend it.

I think it is certainly worth buying if you already own the other three books. Might as well finish the series. If you can get away with just borrowing the book, you'd probably feel a little better after reading it, knowing that you saved money.
As a serious Twilight series fan, I feel terrible for disliking this book, terrible for criticizing Meyer, but I can't like the book no matter how much I try. 
Twilight has had a long battle between those who prefer the relationship of Jacob/Bella (Team Jacob) and those who prefer Edward/Bella (Team Edward). Breaking Dawn was going to be the big bang, and we were all ready and waiting. However, after reading it, I can't help but think: Team Jacob never had a dying chance, and Team Jacob didn't even have a chance at a *decent* ending. Team Edward got what they wanted, but it seemed to happen tastelessly and all too perfectly. I have two words for you: convenient coincidences. This book solely thrives on convenient coincidences.
The book certainly does have a few good points. The mystery of Bella's half-breed child and Bella's "shielding" gift was exciting. The relationship between Jacob and his wolf pack was heartbreaking and noble. The new point of view from Jacob was fresh. However, that is all I have to say for this book...and with it's monstrous length (over 750 pages) you would think it would be very satisfying and thorough. In my opinion, it felt rushed but full of open gaps and loopholes at the same time. Not a good combination.
Fairy tales are supposed to be full of magic, good coincidences, and lovely endings. However, Breaking Dawn just seems to work out all too perfectly. Problems are solved by a simple coincidence or by simple perfection. May I list a few instances? Bella has a mutant spawn inside of her body, ready to kill her. Solution? The baby is able to talk to Edward and vice versa, and when she comes out she has super intelligence and she has the power to make everyone love her. There was a tragic love story between Edward, Bella, and Jacob. Solution? Edward and Bella have a baby together, Jacob imprints on that baby, and they get to be one big happy family. 
Girls might have been able to relate with Bella Swan in earlier books...but with Breaking Dawn, I can't imagine anybody who can relate to her. If you ask any girl who reads the Twilight series about Bella, there is a 90% chance that the girl will say "Oh, I LOVE Twilight, but I think Bella is actually kind of annoying. I read the series for [insert other person here, such as Edward, or Jacob, or the Cullens]. Who knew it was possible to love a series but hate the main character? I think Bella Swan needs a change in character development. Besides, who can relate to Bella Swan now, now that she has had every single desire (plus more) fulfilled so perfectly without any loss?
Also, you may hear from other Twilight fans that the final scene with the Volturi was extremely disappointing. Even though I wasn't too fond of the overall story, I was looking forward to the fight. Meyer even described the vampires who came to witness for the Cullens enough for us to understand their skills and personalities. I grew to like these vampires. All for what? The Volturi turning back and running away? Wow. Perhaps she should have just cut out all the pages about the extra vampires. They weren't really needed anyway.
On a final note: you will either be very satisfied with Breaking Dawn, or you will despise it. Ultimately, I think it is worth reading to know how the series ends, but that doesn't mean you'll be left with a better ending than the one in your head. And when fans are left thinking of better endings than the one the author provided...that just isn't a good thing.

My older Braun 8595 needed $30 worth of new cutting blades and foils, so being a typical dumb male, I decided to buy a new $215 Braun 9595 instead.
Well, turns out that the 9595 provides the exact same shave quality as the 8595, but is a bit noisier, with somewhat lower build quality, and with a goofier LCD display than the 8595 has.
And the 9595's packaging is an embarrassment -- it reminds me of Apple's original iPod packaging, simply a terrible waste of paper and plastic.
The 9595's "Pulsonic" quality claims are meaningless. Believe me, it doesn't provide any better or closer shave than its predecessor, the 8595. I was foolish to purchase it.
Its only improvement seems to be a "quick clean" setting on the cleaning base -- which seems to be the normal "economical clean" without the drying cycle. Big deal!
Braun really relied on its marketing department for this 9595 design, instead of its engineering department. Bad Braun!! Buy the 8595 instead, save $100!! Don't get 'suckered' by Braun's advertising.

I switched from TurboTax to TaxCut for my 2007 IRS return. It seemed much simpler than TurboTax, and now I know why. I got a letter from the IRS saying that they found errors in my return. I opened up my review produced by 2007 TaxCut and realized that they did not properly handle the stock options given to me by my company. TaxCut simply did not list them because they were already included on my W2. However, they show up on my 1099. The IRS now thinks I understated my income and I'm going to have to hire someone to fix this problem for me. Yes, I did review my tax forms prior to e-filing. My error was trusting that TaxCut would properly file my return without me having to be a tax accountant to know that there was a problem. Yes, I also paid for H&amp;R to review my return for errors. Oops, guess that doesn't work either. Stay away!

This book is about organization. It says very little about prioritization and time-management. It contains nothing about actually *planning* or *doing* anything. The system boils down to making elaborate "what I need to do next" lists for every project you want to accomplish in your life, and to review and update these lists often. For every item on your list, either trash it, delegate it, save it for later, or just do it. It's good advice if you find yourself stuck at a roadblock or overwhelmed by a sheer number of tasks.
According to the book, pretty much every project consists of an endless string of simple tasks such as "call X", "email Y", and "attend meeting with Z". Unfortunately the book barely discusses the planning required for difficult jobs that involve significantly more time and forward thinking than accomplishing the most immediate step. It's all about "go go go" and "do do do". If you have five minutes to spare, it's time to check your list for a call you could make or an email you could write. The resulting productivity strikes me as borderline manic. If you need to keep a folder of Post-It notes in a filing cabinet to deal with your spouse (as the book suggests), you've got problems.
Regarding the actual text, the book is too long (only Chapters 4-9 are needed, the rest is self-referential filler), too general, and written condescendingly in an annoying office-speak lingo that will make anyone who actually *does* work for a living (ie: not management) cringe.
If your path to inner bliss involves relying on your CPA to remind you when to purge your tax archives so you can free up your mind to relax with a glass of chardonnay by your koi pond at sunset, then you'll love this book.

What a lame ending to an otherwise fun guilty pleasure. 
Some spoilers ahead (if you have somehow avoided being spoiled up to now). 
Just so we're clear: I don't care about the "message"--I didn't need Bella to become a better being or stronger or less boyfriend-centric (I had already given up on that)--and I was pretty much over the fact that my preferred boyfriend (the werewolf) was losing because Bella, obviously, can't live without Edward. And that's fine for what this story is.  
What bothered me about this book is that it was sort of just dull. And Jacob's story had a mildly disturbing resolution. 
The first third of the book is Bella's romance with Edward culminating in sex (finally!). Almost nothing happens except that she gets mysteriously pregnant (which seemed to go against everything Meyer had established about how her vamp world worked but I could roll with it if it was fun). 
The second part of the book--the only reason this gets two stars--is from Jacob's POV. Likely because his is the only tolerable POV since he's so full of angst and confused. The resolution of his POV is super weird and odd and a little creepy. He imprints on a deeply inappropriate character (made doubly sad by the fact that he had already expressed that imprinting meant he just got to make one less choice in his life so it seemed he was deeply torn about imprinting but since the POV changes we'll never know). 
In the final third of the book NOTHING happens. You feel like something is going to happen--and there are even subplots involving plotting with Alice that you think are going somewhere but they don't. 
The entire final third of the book is to provide Bella with stunning beauty, more power than any other vampire (seemingly), a "forever" love with Edward, a tethered best friend in Jacob (whom she IMMEDIATELY and repeatedly notes has NO pull on her WHATSOEVER now that she's immortal--Hey Bella? We get it, thanks), a gorgeous daughter (with a dumb name) that will live dozens of years (at least), a family, her human family--everything. 
The final third just drags on and on with every character heaping random praise on Bella's beauty and power and I was so disappointed with the lack of suspense--there isn't even a fight! Just some thematic conversations about free will vs. subjugation that is never answered or deeply explored--except for the fact that so many of the characters seem to not have any will when it comes to love that you can't help but feel that love is both wonderful and oddly horrible. There's no room to breath in the love relationships characters have for each other in this book. The entire thing felt claustrophobic and tedious.
Really, they couldn't have cut that J. Jenks thing? It went nowhere! TWO WHOLE CHAPTERS of nothing!

I never liked James Bond and "Quantum of Solace" just furthered my dislike of the movie series. 
      Compare James Bond to Jason Bourne, two out of the three "JBs" in spy movies (Jason Bourne, Jack Bauer, and James Bond). Jason Bourne does not sleep with any woman he can find, he feels his kills and does not kill for no reason, and is not a cold-hearted killer. James Bond is all of those things and more. He strikes me as a very dangerous and unkind person. Why would you want to make movies about someone like that?
     I'm not disparaging the acting talents of Daniel Craig in any way, or any of the previous actors, but I think the whole premise of James Bond is flawed. That doesn't mean they're badly made movies, they're not. But they're morally irresponsible. And, in the world we have today, we don't need more of that than we already have.

The overall functioning of this laptop is adequate.  I have to keep reminding myself that Vista and Office 2007 are not hp's fault.  Eliminating those gripes shortens this list dramatically.  But the problem remains that (compared to my venerable hp zv5000) certain aspects of the layout and hardware of this laptop are very disappointing.  Here are my specific complaints:
1.  The touchpad is a piece of garbage.  You cannot adjust the scroll speed and the pointer sometimes jumps around the screen for no reason.  Also, the buttons feel like they belong on a dimestore toy -- far too much play.
2.  The wireless toggle (a sliding bar) is located such that it is not protected when I close the laptop.  It often gets accidentally and unwittingly turned off when I take the computer in and out of my bag.
3.  The volume control touchpad is located such that when I use the delete key with my left hand, my ring finger rests on the volume controls.  This essentially renders my laptop unusable until the computer stops turning itself up/down for about two minutes.
4.  After I've shut it down, the computer will often turn itself back on when I pick it up to store it in my bag.
5.  Quickplay will sometimes launch for no reason -- usually immediately following a spontaneous reboot.

Like everyone else who complained about this product, I had it for about a year now and then suddenly I could not access any data on it.  
Symptom looked like this:  The drive made a clicking sound, Windows XP could see the drive when USB is plugged in, but could not access the data on it.
The chassis mechanicals were put together in an awkward manner, so it was not easy for me to take it apart.  I finally took out the hard drive from inside, installed it into my computer main chassis as a secondary hard drive.  Powered it up, and saw the XP operating system detected the new drive and did a scan on it, it then fixed a file system inconsistency error found, and then booted into Windows XP on the computer's primary drive.  
The XP could then see and access this secondary drive, and looked like all my data were there.   But the plastic chassis was sort of ruined when I opened it, so I'll keep it as an additional secondary internal hard drive.  Had it been easier to take the drive out, I could have still used it as an external.  Oh well, I am just glad that I didn't lose the data.
Other people who had the same symptom may want to check and see if this would rescue their data.

The cycles are 1) mixing 2) rising 3) kneading 4) rising 5)baking.
Our previous breadmaker was a Panasonic, which made nice, light, well textured bread. 
The bread so far on the Zojirushi is heavy on the bottom of th loaf and too light on the top, indicating that cycle (3) does not knead the dough long enough. 
The last loaf, made today, is still not right, but is better, probably because we used a fast rising yeast. 
We are now trying to reprogram the cycle times. 
We understand that each breadmaker is different. We are trying to find the right combination for the bread recipe we want to use. Since we have not yet found the correct (for us) program, we are ubnable to rate the machine at this time.

I didn't bother to read the reviews because it just seemed like time to update from a much earlier version.  Last year they only had a "deluxe" version with complex multi-tagged displays that were almost unreadable, so a return to a basic version seemed promising.  Now I can just return it unopened.
This company apparently makes its profit from corporate clients because both Quicken Deluxe and Turbotax now require a specialized vocabulary and intricate accounting skills.  That makes sense for Turbo since they want to sell personal service and mimicking TaxCut without its occasional errors would allow normal people to do their own taxes.  It probably makes sense with Quicken too since they undoubtedly charge for help.  Given Vista, it is hard to imagine Microsoft being simpler, so we may be back to the old days of paper.
It's a deceptively labeled product from a haughty company, but there may be no decent alternative in this age of mature markets with minimal competition.

Pomimo faktu ze pare dni temu ugryzl mnie pies i moja lewa noga przechodzi przez kolejne fazy umiarkowanego zwatpienia, spiesze dostaczyc moj komentarz do filmu Clinta Eastwooda 'Changeling' (Dvd, 2009). Film z udzialem Angeliny i Malkowicza jest oparty na prawdzie historycznej o tyle, na ile wyglada wyglada sztucznie, niczym przyslowiowa 'proteza zebowa Cioci Kloci'.  
Eastwood opowiada historie matki (Angelina Jolie), ktora poszukujac zaginionego synka mocuje sie ze skorumpowanym Departamentem Policji w Los Angeles, pod koniec lat 20-tych zeszlego stulecia. Na pomoc samotnej matce przychodzi lokalny pastor (John Malkovich), wytykajacy w swoich mszalnych i radiowych kazaniach polityczne kumoterstwo miejscowych wladz. 
Zdziebko napieta akcja filmu oraz wprawnie dobrana garderoba, nie sa jednak w stanie zamaskowac ordynarnego braku maszyny produkujacej gaz cebulowy we lzawych zblizeniach Angeliny. Rezyser wraz z producentami filmu wydaja sie obrazac jego odbiorcow w sposob jawnie nieskrepowany, wypychajac w naszym kierunku calkiem odwodniona chale.
Pogryziony.

I've heard amazing things about the Chi flat irons, so when my cheap Conair flat iron broke, I chose to spend the money on this straightener. It worked fine for a while, but after 3 months it stopped working completely. There's no warranty for the product if it's bought online, so it was a waste of money. I went to Target and bought a T-Studio Tourmaline Digital Straightener and it works better than my Chi, has temperature control, and has a 4-year warranty. The Chi definitely wasn't worth the money that I spent for the short amount of time it worked.

I wish I would have listened to a few of the reviews that said to save up for a better option.  This thing is REALLY bad in low lighting.  The videos I have in low lighting are very pixelated and not even worth while.  And when I say low lighting, I mean not a super sunny clear day.  If it's as dark as a lit room of your house you will not get quality shots.  I have yet to use this on a nice sunny day, but so far I'm a bit disappointed.  I couldn't imagine using it for trail riding going from light to dark.  I realize it was only $90 or so, but it's still very worth while to save up and spend an extra chunk of cash.  
The only redeeming qualities of this thing is that it seems to stand up to shocks decently.

Compared to the first installment of the series, "New Moon" absolutely draaaags on for about 350+ pages before any action resembling that of its predecessor takes place.
My advice? Save yourself hundreds of pages of Bella being morose &amp; moody, and find yourself a good "Twilight" spoiler site to get the main gist of this book. It's worth skipping over--or, at the very most, skimming over 85% of the book and reading the last few chapters only.

I'm still using Quicken 2005 which I upgraded from Quicken 2002 (or something like that). I'd heard good things about Windows Quicken. After reading the reviews of both the Mac and Windows versions and the hassles of converting, I looked elsewhere. MoneyDance was recommend by one of the reviewers. I checked it out, importing the QIF file from my Quicken 2005. Lots of duplicates, etc.--the types of problems described by reviewers. And I discovered in MoneyDance that changing the category list (merging, deleting, etc) and altering account information that had been imported incorrectly required manual editing of an XML (??) file (Thank you MoneyDance for useful user forums). 
IBank (sold here on Amazon) looks really cool. I downloaded the demo, imported my Quicken QIF, and it looks almost flawless. One account quicken no longer displayed correctly and I couldn't figure out the problem, was accurate  in iBank--come on Quicken, you can export the data, why can't you display it. Anyway, I believe my search is over. The demo lets you import all your data but limits sessions to 15 minutes which I think is a thoughtful solution for an adequate evaluation; also a 30 day money back quarantee.

I was very disappointed in this book.  After beginning to read the first 3 books, I couldn't put them down.  I would stay up late and get up early just to read more.  This book took me a couple of weeks to get through.  From page 1 to the last page I wondered why I was reading it and what a tragic summation to the other 3 books.
I was very disappointed with the whole baby thing as well as her becoming a vampire.  The whole thing with Jacob and the baby bothered me because he was settling for something that was only apart of who he truly loved.  I enjoy a good fairy tale, however this was simply a fairy tale.
I would recommend buying the first 3 because you will read them over and over again.  I would recommend checking this book out at the local library before making the purchase.  I hope that Hollywood is planning on making movies out of all of the books.  My only fear is that they will take this book for what it is and not change it to glamorize the characters as they usually do.  I would like to see them make this better.  First and last time I think I'll ever say that.

The film starts off well enough, when they were kids in the slums.  In particular were some scenes on an Indian train that reminded me of some scenes in Gandhi.  Seeing the evil people using kids to beg on the street really hit home with me, it's everywhere in China.  And it's sick.  There were also some good, funny moments during the interrogation scenes when Jamal stood up to his tormenters.
But I don't think the romance worked at all.  The relationship with his brother didn't feel real at all either, it felt very tacked on.  And I found it hard to care about the main character, especially because he spends half his screen time mute, staring into space.
Will he win the money and the girl or lose both.  I didn't care at all one way or the other.  I didn't find much fun in the film, and there's absolutely nothing there to think about.
It really is the worst Oscars ever.

I had just thought people who said it turned into a paperweight had been doing something wrong...until it happened to me.  I'm tech savvy enough to know that this drive is DEAD. Fortunately, I had purchased two of these clunkers and will immediately get a non-Simpletech product to offload all 36gb of my music files.  Gotta backup my backup!
Anyway, notice that so far, 36 people give this drive only one star.  They are not crazy.  If I had reviewed it 6 months ago, I would have given it five stars.  DANGER:  If you care about your data, do not under any circumstances purchase this product.  One day, yours too will become a useless paperweight when Windows doesn't see the drive at all.

Yes, I read the other reviews (and you should too) warning about the issues with leopard. I proceeded anyway since there were also claims that the firmware update fixed the issues. I've had other western digital drives in the past and they performed well and I had no complaints so I took the chance. 
The day I got my drive, I opened the box and it had a notice about the issue ("Attention Leopard (10.5) users").  I then followed the instructions to find the support solution referenced on the notice but I could not find it.  After getting a response from western digital support the indicated that the solution had been deleted and the firmware download removed from their website. So the short recommendation is:
LEOPARD USERS: DO NOT BUY THIS UNTIL THE YOU SEE THE FIRMWARE UPDATE AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD. 
Hopefully by then new drives will just have the right firmware at that point but at least you'd be able to update it in the event it's not.
And in case you were thinking of just using it anyway, take heed for the other reviews with warnings and finally WDC support did recommend backing up the data before doing the firmware upgrade (when it becomes available). Not a particularly useful solution if this was meant to be your backup drive.
How any company can deliver a product intended for use by Mac users that has significant problems with the current version (10.5, Leopard) is mind boggling.

The router needs reboot every day, which really sucks.
As far I can understand from postings on the net, it seems that Linksys around november 2005 (starting with rev. 5) changed the operating system in the router from Linux to WxWorks. This was problably so they could save HW as the ram has gone from 16MB to 8MB and the flash has gone from 4 MB to 2 MB.
The older revisions should be very solid, but I can only recommend AGAINST buying this new version ... If you want Linksys: get an older one if you can...
Also I seriously doubt that you can get the Linux based SW to run since RAM and flash is only half of the previuos versions.

It would be better if this book didn't even exist. After I read halfway through it, I wanted to put it down and pretend like I'd never read any of it. There were some good parts and plot twists, but other parts are too strange and simply unsettling to let go. This was NOT a good way to end the series. It should've been like the seventh Harry Potter book, with a battle of good vs. evil at the end with a few casualties on the side. It wasn't. It was a cop-out.
I don't regret buying the book simply because I liked the wolf parts, but everything from the middle on was unbearable. I went from being the Switzerland of the Jake-Edward debate to being fully pro-Edward and feeling sorry for Jake. Stephenie Meyer ruined him. It was like she didn't even write the last book. Good ideas were twisted and mutilated into stupid and happy-go-lucky crap. Sorry, fans of this book.
If you like Twilight, buy this book used. Save yourself some money. It's worth reading and keeping as a collector's item, but I wanted to go back and mark out all the idiotic parts. That would include blacking out all but maybe twenty or thirty pages.

I bought this camera for the simple reason that it was so small and can capture video to flash memory. The packaging is rock solid and you can tell the build quality is very good. I don't have any use for taking digital pics with this unit and the reviews are correct.. It lacks in that dept but is ok if your expectations are low. This camera takes great video but the auto focus is very slow and in most cases you have to hold the camera very still to get a good video shot. Also, if your in anything less than bright sunlight you will have noisy/grainy video. The zoom feature is also very very slow but it will reach out there. One more thing worth mentioning. If you buying this camera to upload videos to you pc like me make sure you have the horsepower to play them. The files are massive and if your trying to display on a high def monitor you might need a dedicated video card with min 256MB ram. 
I had to send this back only because when I saw the quality of the video it could take in bright sunlight then compared it to what I got in the house with a few lights on I was really disapointed. I'm going to pay the extra cash and try the new Sony...

I will skip over all the good things this player has to offer (battery life, optical zoom, features, 16:9 format) and get right to the showstopper I came across: The video images are skewed, i.e. the proportions are off! Practically speaking, if you record something in 16:9 mode, the resulting video is horizontally compressed and people look squeezed and too thin. I've done a number of experiments and research and also talked to Samsung tech support and it boils down to the following design flaw: Unless you use the web and mobile mode (meant for YouTube etc.), the image format produced by the player is ALWAYS 720 x 480, regardless if you record in normal mode or 16:9. 720 x 480 equals an width/height ratio of 1.5. A 16:9 image should be a width/height ratio of 1.78 while a 4:3 image should be a ratio of 1.33. But the player always reformats and distorts images to fit the 720 x 480 format. Therefore regardless of the mode, all images are distorted and there's nothing you can do about it. Tech support confirmed this. 
I'm not sure why nobody else has commented on this yet, but to me this is a killer because video always looks distorted and the proportions are off. I am now returning this camcorder for this very reason.
I had bought it to document the birth of my 1st son and now all I have is distorted video. Very disappointing. I ended up purchasing QuickTime Pro which offers the functionality to resize video, but the resulting quality is obviously not as good as the original should have been.
Do not buy this camcorder if you cannot live with distorted images/video!

The pump started out being fairly quiet with very little vibration. After only a week of usage, the pump noise become unbearably loud and the whole unit shook from how much the pump was vibrating. My cat refused to drink from such a noisy fountain and would only drink when the fountain is unplugged. I tried taking the whole unit apart, including disassembling the pump, and cleaning the parts, but nothing worked. Also the way the water stream hit the bottom of the unit would always cause some splashing. The flying specks of water further discouraged my cat from drinking from it.
Now the fountain is sitting in a cardboard box, catching dust in a corner of my room.

I recently purchased a D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router and several D-Link DWA-130 Wireless N USB Adapters together. The DIR-655 installed without a hitch and works well with several Linksys wireless G adapters I have. It also works with the DWA-130s but not nearly as well as I had expected. The biggest disappointment is that although the DWA-130s reports that they are attached to the router at 130 MBPS, the effective transfer speed to the network-attached storage box that's plugged into an Ethernet port on the DIR-655 is somewhat slower than it was using the 56 MBPS wireless-G router and adapter that this setup replaces.

So I got his about a month ago and it worked alright. There were certain songs that when played would cause the player to freeze and I'd have to restart it which was a pain. The weird thing was that only certain songs caused the player to freeze, these songs had been purchased from the online wal-mart store adn were WMA formated. go figure. So then one day I was installing a firmware upgrade and because the USB cable was so short I had to rig something on the back of my comp. for it to sit on, but unfortunately the player fell off and the cord came out mid-installing. now whenever I turnit on it instantly freezes no matter what. Im so sick of dealing with all the bugs on this system. Also i had about 1700 songs on it and going trhough them all with the little buttons was a PAIN!

Last time I purchased a Netgear product it was a solid and competent wireline router in a blue metal box. That purchase influenced me to go for WGR614. 
Boy times change! What I got for my money was a soapbox made from cheap plastic. The setup was a slow and on-going battle. To illustrate the point - the out-of-the-box DHCP served addresses but a client could not ping the router back!
Finally I was through all this only to discover that this pile of garbage cannot hold wireless connection. It was a total disaster for me considering that I had a naive hope to use it with VPN tunnel to my office network. All prior notes from other customers on instability of wireless connection are very true (overheating seems to be very likely the cause).
Therefore, I cannot recommend this equipment, however, if you are stuck with it, you can generally make it a useable product by either 
a) leveraging a vaunted by manufacturer small footprint in your fridge, thus preventing overheating
b) sparely use wireless only for occasional surfing, do all work which counts using wireline.
What I can recommend is a Cisco product called Linksys WRT54GS. Bought it instead of WGR614. The speed booster seems a marketing trick, however, for few extra $$ you get the last dinosaur of deservedly praised v4 platform of WRT54 series. It is fully free of all malaises attributed to WRT54G, which is currently retailed in v5.
Finally, if you go for broadband router product - go for brick and mortar. Amazon.com restocking charges are hefty.

Can a product be so bad I will uninstall and go back to the clunky buggy Mac Office 2004? I think so. Also, do not do what I did and let the installation program convince you to remove all prior versions: now I not only have to go back and reinstall the old program, but all updates too. 
2008 was supposed to be faster and fix all the bugs from 2004. And I believed them. It fixed one print bug and added many new bugs. One delightful one: parts of text disappear in normal and  preview, but reappear when you highlight the section. It seems that the text is there, you just can't see it. Plus, print view is screwed up. They arbitrarily reassigned the locations of several menu items, usually moving to another area and then to a new submenu. LOTS of new submenus. Stunningly, they no longer found space for RECENT in the main FILE menu, Now, to find your list of recent documents, you have to do to the FIle menu, then to a new submenu for recent documents.  
Oh, and it is slower than ever, Universal Binary code notwithstanding. 
Apart from the bugs and clunkiness, it seems that every single change they made makes the program less suitable to the way I use a word processing program. If my clients did not use MS, I would go to Mac "Pages" and never look back. 
I won't even comment on the problems of going back and forth between the .doc format and the new .docx format. I am sure others have addressed that joy.
One amusing note. Initially they arbitrarily replaced the toolbar icon for "Save as" to a new, stupid icon with a stylized MS "O" for office. Apparently I was not the only one who hated this: one of the two (so far) massive "updates" changed the icon back to "Save as"

We purchased this upgrade because Microsoft no longer supports the version of Outlook we had on our computer and we needed to link with other software so we had to upgrade. We decided to upgrade the whole suite--big mistake. The helpful folks at Microsoft have come out with another unintuitive product that makes more things "automatic", which is very unhelpful. It has removed or hidden some features I used in the former version on a daily basis (for example, the ability to add columns in a simple table in Word--now I have to import an Excel spreadsheet instead--although I can add all sorts of more complex formulas to a Word table--that's just strange). Yet again my Big Brothers at Microsoft have decided that THEY know what I need better than I do so they will make my choices for me. By doing so, they have also made the program much slower and, surprise, sloppier. It's pretty, though--lots of new icons instead of WORDS (imagine that in a WORD PROCESSING PROGRAM!). Guess it would be great if I were ILLITERATE!

The Norelco T-980 price was not much more than the cost of replacing the battery in my 10-year old Norelco Maverick T-3000 and I was excited about the addition of a vacuum feature. Be careful what you wish for! The vacuum does its job and sink cleanup is definitely faster. But the vacuum feature tends to obscure your view of the blade edge making it much trickier to aim the thing at your beard's edge while looking in the mirror. The vacuum must be emptied by using thumb pleasure to disengage one side of a rather flimsy, curved compartment cover that swings open on a hinge that looks so weak that I'm afraid it's just a matter of time before I accidentally break either the hinge or snap the cover in half. Equally delicate-feeling are the two sliding, plastic prongs used to hold the primary blade in place. Yet it must be removed each time one wants to use the smaller, more accurate trimming blade. And of course the trimming blade uses similar prongs to hold it in place. My older T-3000 had a self-contained trimming blade that slid forward with a simple thumb push whenever needed and then retracted just as easily. The T-980 is larger around and heavier than the older unit... enough so that I really miss the sense of control and precision I was used to. In short, the T-980 feels clumsier, less maneuverable, and less accurate. It takes longer to complete the job due to the hassle of changing the regular blade and the trimming blade. And it really tries my patience having to be so careful not to beak one of those delicate, sliding, plastic prongs or the vacuum-compartment cover. I'm really tempted to pay the $30 it will cost to restore my old T-3000.

Finally, after all the above frustrations, it managed to jam itself and will not accept or download data.

So Steve expresses that we women need to act like a lady and think like a man! Honestly, Steve didn't tell me anything that I wasn't already doing as far a having standards go. I understood Steve's point of view when he stated that the 3 things men do to show women that they really love them are to profess, provide and protect and if he doesn't have his life together he probably will not be looking for a relationship. Well I must be a man then, because this is how I think. As a woman I need to do these things as well.   
   To me this book was one-sided, of course because Steve is man and he speaks from a male view.  He really didn't tell ME anything I did not know, in actuality most of the things he expressed were common sense. Now maybe I'm just an alien of a woman, but for women to come out and say that this book is SOME sort of miracle of a book is plainly ridiculous.  And to speak about this 90 day rule, what about those who believe in celibacy, or those who know the repercussions there are in premarital sex...This is really the type of book that you want to give your daughters? Oh Okay, right!!  
   So you must give in to the man's need for sex because he lacks self-control and has to have "the cookie"? And it's odd that as a Christian, steve would condone such actions. Again I'm no judge, I'm am stating my opinions.  Okay read, there were some good points made (again not that I didn't know but for the masses maybe) and there were some blatantly wrong statements made! His chapter on the independant woman being lonely made some sense but it also lacked some sense. My theory is that a man can profess, provide, and protect a woman but he can be just as much a man in being with a strong independant woman who can do these things as well. He should know he is a man, he shouldn't need affirmations and confidence boosts from a woman to define him and make him one. Bottom line, man or woman, Know who you are and what you stand for and you'll be fine.

Because I read such great reviews of this unit I picked it over the less expensive Krups and Cuisinart burr grinders. Having spent an hour trying to set the Capresso up, I now regret my decision.
First, what people say about following the directions when setting up the hopper is true. It has a cheap, thin plastic collar that will break if torqued even slightly. I know this because it broke even though I was closely following directions. For $90, the company should have made the collar more durable, especially considering the hopper will be removed and replaced often.
Plus, the hopper would not fit onto the base correctly. Again, following the directions carefully I could not get it to set evenly. Maybe the burr wasn't seated correctly as some have noted. I couldn't remove the "removable" burr, so I can't say.
Anything this fragile and difficult isn't worth owning. It's a piece of badly designed junk in my opinion and is being returned tomorrow.
Go for something else and forget the Caprisso 560.

This USB Drive is very poorly made.  I expected more from Kingston, who I always regarded as producing a good product.  The metal USB connector, which ejects out of the main body in a clumsy, non-smooth fashion, is too easily bent up and down, opening the seems of the plastic case.  Also, the body design itself seems to be too wide for some (admittedly older) USB ports.  Overall, I expected a sturdier outer casing.  In terms of data storage, however, I have no complaints.

We have been blessed with new neighbors with three large dogs.  The dogs bark at everyone who passes, including my family every time we enter our back yard.  I purchased the Petsafe PBC00-11216 in an attempt to tone this annoyance down and left it in place for three weeks.  I mounted it on a post facing their yard and noticed no reaction from the dogs.  The indicator turned on in response to the barking, but the dogs did not seem to react at all.

This book is a waste of time. It doesn't cover some of the popular  restaurants in my area of the country. The book also only covers a few of the items on the menu. I would be better off reading the description on the menu and asking the waiter how it is prepared, or use common sense.

I'm probably going to get flayed for this but this movie wasn't great because it had no where to get greatness from. I mean Twilight was 500+ pages of glaring, staring, growling, flinching and glittering so how does that translate into a film? Poorly. People complain that it moves too fast in the movie, that Bella and Edward fall in love too quickly. It only feels like it took longer for them to fall in love with each other in the book because the book had chapters of filler to make it seem like they actually had time to build up to their "epic" love...and they didn't. 
I'm giving this movie 2 stars because I actually did like the baseball scene...well, up until the end when it got cheesy with the crouching standoff. The graphics could have been better. The fast running was just comical and the glitter made him look like a muppet! And was it just me or was Carlise so pale when he came on screen that someone, ANYONE in that town should have said, "Um...Doctor, are you okay?" He looked like he should have been in a bed getting a transfusion instead of treating patients. 
I also gave this 2 stars instead of 1 because I like Robert Pattinson. He was worth at least one star even though most of the movie he looked constipated or intense for no reason what so ever. The bad part about this is that I thought Twilight was the best book out of the series so that doesn't leave me with much hope that the rest of the movies will get any better.

This is unbelieveably noisy. Wow! Sounds like a leafblower. It shaves half descent but takes longer than my old Norelco. It also has a tendancy to nick. 
Now that I have replaced my battery in my Norelco, I am going back to it. After a month of using the Remington, I am tired of being "attacked" each morning. I'll keep it as a backup - only.

I sent this back for refund. The design was cumberson and capricous. The food pusher had to go in one way, not the other way and had a hole in the bottom so you could not use for liquids...the cutting blades did a horrible job of mushing the food rather than shredding the potatoes. Very disapointed. Bought a Black and Decker and was happy.

The scale looks nice, and yes, its got kind of a nice feature set. But mine broke after only six months. Put in new batteries, nothing happens. No problem, right? its got a 1-year warrantee! Sucker. I called the company to get some help. They were brusque and borderline rude, accusing me of not knowing how to work it. I was at work, but they said I'd need to call them from home with the scale and to go out and buy four brand new batteries and put them into the unit while they were talking with me on the phone. Hey, I know how to put batteries into a scale, okay? The kicker was that if they signed off on that part, I'd have to pay to ship the scale crosscounty and back!! By the time I did that, it would almost be the cost of a new scale. No wonder they offer a "warrantee". Some customer service. I just trashed it.
All in all, a terrible experience - crappy product and crappy, weasel service.

This drive was a huge disappointment.  I bought it some months ago because it was on sale, opened it and let it sit.  The first time I tried to use it - NOTHING.  Tried to format it, and even though it shows up in Explorer as "Removable Disk", formatting fails with a "There is no disk in Drive G:" "Insert a disk and try again".  No recovery software, no fix software, no help on the Transcend web site, and a manual that appears to have been written by accident.

Had I not have just purchased a very fine wire hair comb for $8 from Petco I might be leaving the high feedback you see for this product also.  BUT, this $8 wire brush from Petco is actually FASTER at removing hair/fur than theis FURminator is.  So, if you have a Petco near you or another pet  store, look for brush with small, stiff, fine, closely spaced wires and you will save yourself a bundle.

I own the 2GB version of this drive. It is tiny, but still fits nicely into a USB port, but I have noticed a serious problem. The flash stick itself is actually smaller than the casing it is in (you can see it on the bottom). I have been very careful with how I store my super stick and careful in inserting and removing it from USB ports. Regardless, the plastic shell around the memory stick is breaking across the width at the top, and the bottom corners of the plastic shell (that go into a USB port) have started snapping off in little chunks.

The Twilight series has been going down hill since the 2nd book. This book is even worse than the mediocre New Moon. The plot is completely gone, and Stephanie Meyer trudges on with reused material for 300 pages and DESTROYS all believable personalities left. I had to make myself finish reading the last 200 pages of this piece of literary purge by SM and her Morman housewife fantasies.

This movie is likely one of the most ridiculous turkeys ever to besmirch the silver screen.  My only regret in reviewing it is that I was forced to give it at least one star.  The only redeeming quality of this movie (aside from a scantily clad Lea Thompson) is that it's a delight to pick apart.  Seriously, ignore all the positive reviews -- this thing is one of the worst movies of ALL TIME!  Hilariously bad at times, but never intentionally.
Happy viewing.

I give this thing ONE star ... I wouldn't even give it "1" if I could.
Let's begin with a little background. I've bought/use many D-Link products for home and my personal business and am very happy and 99.999% satisfied with its quality, performance, and price. I've used their A, B, G, &amp; N wireless routers, network cards, and PCMCIA cards.
First, Setup. This may not be so crucial to some. When using the setup CD, you must have it connected to the internet for you to complete the setup - LAME for those of us proffessionals who practice setup on a stand-alone pc before putting it into production level. Manual setup - the worst menu driven system. It is similair to the old ones - yet some of the basics is annoyingly placed. But okay - whatever. Not a big deal.
Second, DHCP with assigned static IP's - I have a couple network printers with odd MAC addresses that begin with 08:00 for some silly reasons - this router don't like it and while it still assigns an IP, I have no control over it. A little irritating - but whatever.
The first and second would only reduce my 99% rating (nothing can be perfect yet) to maybe 90%... however, the following issue well - destroys any attempt at perfection it may have had.
The most important aspect for general users: It drops packets and has major issues with port 80 (your http/web traffic). After a few hours or if someone logs in, or a new wireless connection is made, you gotta reboot this thing to fix it. UNACCEPTABLE!!! I've updated the firmware and got a replacement with similair REV A. A totally unstable product release. It was like an alpha test. Minus 5 stars!
This was the worst product I've encountered from D-Link for a very long time. I use their "N" series NIC/PCMCIA cards with no problems. However, this was the first Wireless-N router I got so I gotta go search some more. Gonna buy two other brands and a different D-Link and compare.

i had this for about a week before it stopped working. out of that week i think i used it three times. i only used it to store movies from satellite receiver. it was hooked up to the same surge protector as everything else. one day i got home from work &amp; noticed it was off thinking it went to sleep, unfortunately it died! this left a bad taste in my mouth as this was the first time i have ever ordered ANYTHING online. bad thing is i live out of the country so my return shipping and import taxes cost more than 75% of the item price and they wont refund that. at least i should have gotten the forty five bucks for the return shipping back from amazon!
the only reason i bought it was the fact that it had a power switch on the back so when i wasnt using it i could make sure that it was off. i ordered the 1TB drive , i should be getting it today, hope this one works. amazon should have an exchange policy for stuff like this. i would prefer that over what i went through to get another one

When Sony Brand HD Camcorders cost $600+ and you can find a HD cam corder for 135.99, that should raise some red flags
Pro's:
Cheap
Very Easy to use (recording). push to record, push to stop. no pause feature. will just make new movies
Small and Light weight
easy to transfer files from camera to windows
Con's:
Poor overall quality
Video recording stutters, when playback video jumps
Have to hold the camera dead still, or else it gets super blurry or it will stutter
I was recording my cats tail with the HD 60fps function and tail still appears as a blur, I am suspicious that this fucntion actually works
the biggest con for me is the video stuttering play back. some scenarios its so bad it looks like a slide show. All the videos ive recorded have this artifact

I have used Quicken on a Mac since 1992 and, because of previous problems with upgrades, I tend to put it off. However, my Quicken 2000 now operates only in Classic mode and I'm at Mac OS 10.4 (Tiger). So an upgrade to Quicken 2007 seemed in order. Having used Quicken for many years the file size has naturally grown and Quicken 2007 repeatedly crashed during the attempt to convert my 2000 version to 2007. The crash code Exception: EXC_BAD_ACCESS Codes: KERN_PROTECTION_FAILURE usually means the program is trying to grab memory that doesn't belong to it and Quicken 2007 has the memory fixed at 20 MB rather than dynamic as most programs in Tiger do.Nor is it possible to increase the memory size for Quicken 2007.
  Quicken 2007 did successfully convert a 10-year-old file that was only 1.7 MB in size so there appears to be a programming error regarding memory allocation.
  Quicken support was useless in this case, with ridiculous suggestions like converting to a .QIF file and importing that to Quicken 2007, which didn't work, or stuffing and unstuffing the file before trying the conversion. No concern about memory allocation ever penetrated to their support group.
  Also, despite carefully backing up my old data, the conversion attempt somehow wiped out all the price information for my investments in Quicken 2000 dating back 15 years. Fortunately, transaction data was preserved in the backups. But my only chance at recovery seems to be a manual input of data.

Stephanie Meyer has said, on more than one occasion, that the story of Bella and Edward was one of true, epic, love. That it wasn't just a story of teen romance - that there was nothing else like it. And I believed! So I was completely blindsided (as I'm sure were the rest of the believers) to have this truly one of a kind love story turned into a truly depressing  love triangle. 
Bella has gone from a girl who has found and is capable of true love to a girl who does the kind of things only a person with a real lack of maturity and compassion is capable of. The Bella we met in Twilight would never have been tempted by what Jacob had to offer or done any of the horrible things she does to Edward in Eclipse. She's lost her relatability.  Not many people would do any of those things to a mediocre boyfriend much less the love of their lives. Jacob has gone from a sweet kid to a man-beast who at his best is immature and at his worst is truly villainous (the whole lying and I'll kill myself if you don't make out with me was repugnant - almost as bad as the fact that Bella - Bella! went for it and Stephenie - Stephanie! wrote this as a love scene!) and Edward is taking poundings from both of them at every turn.
The author must really love Jacob's character - it's the only explanation for what she's done to all of us. But please, please, write a separate series for Jacob and do what you can to salvage Bella and Edward. Do it for those of us who believed.

This is our 3rd (and LAST!) De Longhi expresso maker.
The first one broke after a month.  The replacement had a cracked water tank, right out of the box and the last one (this one) burned the pump after two months!  Even though we cleaned all relevant parts MORE often than the manual even suggests.  We are still waiting for a replacement...
While it worked, the coffee was good but, 2 months is way too short a life span for a product of this type.  And three defective units out of three is too high an average for us to waste out time with De Longhi products again.

This monitor is great when it works.  I bought mine 6 months ago, and now it has ceased working.  I replaced the battery, and still nothing.  I would complain to Omron, but because it was so cheap, it hardly seems worth it.  Especially if the next one fails as well.  Also, the chest strap is too big  for me (I wear a size 8 in US women's clothing, 32 in bra size).  Even if I wear it as tight as it goes, it slips around.  I should have looked at smaller models, so that's entirely my fault.  The short lifespan of the device is most definitely not my fault however.

My first camera was defective.  Pure Digital was no help.  I'm not even sure they have real people working there.  Maybe other people have had better experiences with them, but I got the feeling when I sent my camera back that they just opened my box and stuck my camera in another box and sent it back to me.  I don't think I've ever been so frustrated with a company before.
My hat is off to Amazon, who sent me a replacement camera.  This one works and is just as easy and fun as all the positive reviews imply.  I'm sorry, though, that I had to deal with the manufacturer.  One star for Pure Digital, three stars for the camera (the one that works), and five stars for Amazon.com.

This review is from: Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series [HD DVD] (HD DVD)
      
Unfortunately I was not aware that there were "HD" DVDs that do not play in regular DVD players.  I purchased the Planet Earth Series for my grandson who ABSOLUTELY LOVES Planet Earth.  My daughter called me after Christmas to tell me that none of the 4 DVDs will play in their DVD Player.  They just get a continual message that the DVD is "loading".  I contacted the seller only to be told that if they don't have an "HD" DVD player they may not play.  He went on to inform me that if I return the DVDs and they play in HIS "HD" DVD player I cannot be issued a refund.
I suppose I am responsible since his information DID state "HD" DVD, but I think the seller should have explained the difference in his information and specified the part about the HD" DVD player being required to play the DVDs.
I have since ordered a regular DVD set, and it may even be from this same seller.  
I wonder if anyone else has ever encountered this situation.

twilight used to be story about a girl and a vampire.  then it became a more interesting story about a girl, vampire, and werewolf.   A lot of packages came with the supernatural aspects of vampire and werewolf and a lot of small town romance in between. With Breaking Dawn, Meyer definitely tried too hard by sticking to the supernatural romance while attempting a suitable ending.  Neither one really happened.
In the beginning, Bella and Edward are setting up for a wedding. Bella's pretty young, but marriage isn't too hard to swallow. Yet. In first part, Book 1, there's bits romance, Edward trying to protect Bella, Bella being frustrated by Edward; the "bread and butter" of the Twilight. However, Book1 then becomes about making love, sex, and pregnancy.  That's when the head scratching starts to happen.
Book2, starts out better but gets really awkward, really fast.  Book2 is more about Jacob, which actually helps a lot.  He starts to take a more active role in the pack and appears somewhat decisive.  Then, the pregnancy issues come back into play.  Bella is basically being torn about from the pregnancy. Everything about the birth becomes really really creepy, especially when Jacob "imprints" with Bella's baby at the end of Book2.  I suppose they're meant to be together whenever the baby learns how to walk?
Book3 basically becomes a wrap up section.  The half human-half vampire baby is born, a little fighting here and there, and then the stupidest part: the werewolves in La push aren't actually werewolves.  They're shapeshifters!!  Of all the explanations...shapeshifting? Oh, and they basically can only morph into wolves.  I'm being serious about that too.  
The ridiculous ending isn't necessarily illogical; it's just really really optimistic.  Bella says at the end: And then we continued blissfully into this small but perfect piece of our forever.  Is that really what the fans wanted?
For some reason, Stephanie Meyer changed course and didn't figure out she was lost.  Not only did she make her story really awkward with childbirth and pregnancy, she basically turned her female protagonist into a vampire housewife.  That, while basically making the love triangle into a non factor.  
On her website, S. Meyer has said the fans need time to get used to the ending.  Really, now?  Way to accuse the fans of not understanding your work.  I think if she spent more time writing, a better book would have popped out(no pun intended).  The sad part, is that even if Meyer wrote a great final book, she probably wouldn't have sold any more copies. The hype was everywhere and the bookstores bought into it.  What's even sadder, is that she basically lost a really great chance of clinching the respect from an audience that loved her.

I set this drive as a Time Machine backup for my Mac OS X Leopard 10.5.5.  The drive is absolutely stunning especially with the pretty led lights in the front.  It was great for... two days, and it stopped working right after a simple unplugging of the surge protector that was connected to the computer and the drive.  I also have two other drives in the same computer, they both survived and they've survived these accidents before with no issues.  However, the MyBook Home Ed. could not be used by Time Machine after this.  Used Disk Utility to repair the disk, but it found NO errors on the disk (?), but Time Machine still could not use the disk.  So I tried to reset the drive by unmounting from the OS, then unplugging the power cord from the back of the drive and then back.  This time the drive simply did not even power up.  No lights; it was totally dead.  I have 6 other external drives.  I've never had this kind of failure with any of them.   This drive does get hot, and it has no fan in the unit; so I wonder if that contributes to the high failure rate of WD MyBook....

This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)
      
I have to admit I loved Twilight series when I first read them. But, then I started to think about what it promotes. I think Stephanie Meyer goes too close to the line and uses too much sensuality in a book geared towards teenagers. Her second and third book are much worse. It's sad to see an LDS author lower her standards to reach the national market. She didn't have to. She had a great plot that could have been written without the "steamy sections".
Here's some of the problems I had with the series:
1. Bella is constantly lying to her father.
2. Bella and Edward constantly flirt with going too far.
3. In the 3rd book all Bella can think about is having sex with her boyfriend.
4. Edward constantly stays in Bella's room overnight. They may not do "anything" but that is a recipe for disaster. How many teenagers are going to think that is okay or normal or that they can do that without getting into trouble.
5. Swear Words (even though they are "mild", can't you write a book without them?)
6. In-modest dresses that teenagers are trying to emulate. Stephanie Myers goes to great length to describe Bella's prom dress which was inspired from a runway dress she saw. How many mothers out there are okay with their daughters wearing dresses straight from the model runways?
7. Bella just does what she wants without thinking of others.
Don't even start the series! I wouldn't want my girls to get hooked and then read #3 - Eclipse! That one is definitely crossing the line. Too much sensuality and absolutely no morals! Not a good role model for our teens

8/10/2006: After some early and initial troubles with issues that seemed to be stemming from this router, after many more months of use, i have changed my mind about this router. It has actually provided solid quality during the past months. I don't know why it's not giving me the old problems it did...maybe it was too close to another electrical device or maybe I had some settings set incorrectly.
2005-2006: I get disconnected at least 3 or 4 times a day using these linksys wireless routers. Do your research and buy something like netgear or dlink. At first, i thought it was just one bad apple. However, I currently own 3 linksys routers and dozens of wireless pc and laptop cards, and all of them are giving me problems.
Stay away from these linksys routers. At best, each time i get disconnected i have to restart my pc and the router and wait 10 minutes to get back online again. if you're doing something important, forget it!

I bought a WRT54GS a couple years ago and it still works well.  I wanted another, to run wired and wireless devices in my garage.  To save a few cents on RAM, Linksys changed operating systems and other details on that model, and advertised the WRT54GL as the model similar to my old one.  I bought it, put it away, and finally got to it recently.  I was shocked when I opened it:  the WRT54GL has no wired ports, only a wireless transmitter.  Maybe someone will find that useful, but it's unlikely -- someday you'll have a PC or laptop with a wired port that you want to plug in and cannot because this unit only talks wireless.  It's useless for me, and now it's been too long since I bought it to return it.  Why does Linksys cut corners this way?  Cutting the wired ports cut their costs by $1 or less. Argh.

I bought Breville juicer after using Jack LaLanne's.
I feel very sorry when buying this juicer because it is extremely difficult to control. If pressure is light, fruits or vegies do not go through, and when more pressure is pressed, they go through too fast. And usually at the end of juicing there is a strong jerking motion because fruite or vegies go through UNprocessed, no matter what speed is.
If you use Jack Lalanne before you will love Jack's much more than this. I think this machine is for someone wants to waste fruits or vegetables because the pulp in container is heavier than Jack's.
I use it for 2 weeks and I come back to Jack LaLanne. Breville better RE-designs this one.

Great Camera. the software it comes with is so bad. not like oh I cant edit sort of bad. more like you cant watch the movies or burn them sort of bad. so get ready to spend some more on a converter program and then an editing program. adobe premier is on its way to me. 
Second. the battery. if your dropping a grand on a camcorder you wont mind dropping a couple hundred on accessories. but the battery they supply with the camcorder should not even exist. We should all unite and write to canon demanding a free B-127. it should be a recall that you get a free B-127 if you have bought the HG21 or HG20. completely bogus. 
The sound sucks. get the mic. dm-100. don't try and get the dm-50. it doesn't fit. 
the lighting it bad also. make sure you have the sun on your side. 
the viewfinder is not great. it sits flush so there is no rubber that surrounds your eye. so nothing to keep the sunlight out. thats obvious. I think they just hastily slapped this viewfinder on and forgot the principles of camera making. I mean they have been at it since the seventies. did they forget you need to cover your eye while in the view finder? idiots. 
another design flaw. every time you stop recording it segments the videos. you should be able to put them together on your camcorder. you can break them up just fine. but you cant put them together if you wanted to. but thats why we get adobe premier. 
tripod is necessary. don't go without it. this camera is a dainty little thing. please try not to drop it. 
So get it if you don't mind dealing with the problems i listed. remember to write to canon and tell them the software sucks and you want a free B-127 battery.

I have used Pampers Swaddlers on my baby girl for 16 months with no problems at all.  Then, I finally switched to Cruisers (she's still small, less than 20 pounds, but is walking so I thought it was time to switch when I ran out of Swaddlers).  Well, my first problem with the Cruisers is how cheaply they are made!  The "sticky" closure tabs are a disaster.  In the first package, I must have had at least 5 or 6 that were either missing one or both tabs, or one of the tabs was "sewn" down to the diaper and unusable.  So frustrating!  I hate throwing away an unworn diaper!  Waste of money and just a waste of a diaper.
My daughter also got her very first diaper rash of her entire life within about a week of starting to use the Cruisers.  Never had a single problem with any kind of irritation when she was wearing Swaddlers, but now she seems to get them frequently and they are so bad that they make her squirm and writhe and scream in pain, not only when I'm changing her diaper but any time that she is sitting down while wearing even a slightly dirty/wet Cruisers diaper.  I have 3 bags of these left (luckily I didn't buy a 6-month supply!) and I think I will throw them out.  It wasn't until I read other negative reviews about diaper rashes that I put 2 + 2 together that this must be the cause of my daughter's horrible rashes.  Going to Cruisers is the only change I've made with her and suddenly she is breaking out in open-sored rashes every week.  If I can prevent this agony for her, then it's good-bye Cruisers!!

This review is from: Gone with the Wind (DVD)
      
Why is it that most movie "classics" that are cheered and applauded today turn out to be incredibly lousy? I purchased Gone With The Wind on DVD for my mom nearly a year ago, but it wasn't until this September that we were able to sit down and watch it. And perhaps I've been spoiled by such epics as "Lord of the Rings" and "Spider-Man", but I simply did not find Gone with the Wind enjoyable at all. No, it wasn't simply because there wasn't epic battles or superhero combat, but because the story itself was not entertaining.THE PLOT: Scarlet O'Hara is a southern belle lady living in the lap of luxury with her mother, father, and two sisters on a plantation named Tara. She is the envy of all the ladies, and the desire of all the men. Yet she has her heart fixed on one specific individual, Ashley Wilkes. She is devastated to learn at a party that her Ashley has given his heart to another woman, Melanie. At the same party, famed philanderer and charmer Rhett Butler sees Scarlet and falls in love with her.Meantime, rumors of war are troubling the South. It is rumored that the Union Yankees are readying efforts of war against the South to free the slaves and defeat the Rebels. Celebration comes when it is confirmed that war is abound, and every man able rides to sign up. To get back at Ashley, Scarlet pledges marriage to a young man about to go into battle, but he later dies.Long story made short, they all fight a big war, lots of people killed. Ashley goes off to war, and leaves a pregnant wife in Scarlet's care. Scarlet must attempt to birth the baby in the midst of a huge battle. Rhett manages to come to her aid, but then deserts her to join the army, ashamed of his previous attitude of "only in it for the money" service for the South. Scarlet makes her way home to Tara, and finds her beloved home devastated by war. Her mother dead, her father half-crazy with grief, and the possessions stolen by the Yankees. The rest of the doggone tale is spent chronicling Scarlet's plucky and spirited attempts to save her house, and make true her pledge never to be hungry again, as well as her reckless lifestyle post-war.GOOD: Well, I know I SHOULD be able to find good in this movie, but I'm sorry! It's just that where I come from, we're used to having the main character or characters be GOOD. I can definitely say the acting is good, the music is good, and the scale on which this movie was made certainly reflects excellent quality. BAD: Scarlet is a self-centered idiot who doesn't care who she hurts as long as she gets her way. She callously marries a soldier who is killed in battle, and then despises her mourning clothes she must wear after that. She finally casts off her false mourning to dance with Rhett. She marries another man her sister was in love with, simply to get his money so she can pay off massive taxes on Tara. She stupidly clings to a love for Ashley despite his marriage to Melanie. Interestingly enough, when we are first introduced to Rhett Butler, he's a renown scoundrel, yet even his heart is saddened by the war, and moved by love. Yet Scarlet seems to obtain Rhett's attitude of "only in it for the money". Aside from the morally bankrupt characters, the movie over all is not a positive, upbeat film one might enjoy watching. Death, bloodshed, and violence pervade the film. Did all this stuff happen? Of course! Is it being reclusive and callous not to want to concentrate on all the evils that took place in the Civil War? I think not. THOUGHTS: There is something about this movie that seems to attract fans, despite being fraught with spiteful, cruel characters. Perhaps it is the massive scale on which the movie is shot. There is no question the cinematography is very well done. The music is gorgeous. The acting is commendable. The clothes are a reason often touted when I ask with genuine curiosity "WHY did you like this movie?" But I still must raise objections to good acting, music, and cinematography all surrounding a bunch of 1800's jerks. You decide. I personally was disappointed to recognize the actor playing Ashley Wilkes as the actor who had previously starred in an ancient TV serial of Sherlock Holmes. The man was perfect for the role, and carried it out brilliantly, so to see him as the sniveling Rebel soldier was almost sad for me. I've gotten my main point across, but being as this movie is a genuine classic, I don't doubt most of you will want to buy it. If you do, you'll probably prefer the DVD. *Note* The DVD contains hardly any extras: Theatrical trailer, and a few quizzes. I give this movie 2 out of 10 stars.

Not good.  
Excel / Word -- Microsoft replaced the old toolbars with "ribbons".  If you're new to Office, you may like the ribbons. If you have been using office for a while and prefer to use shortcut keys instead of the mouse, you will hate it.  I haven't seen any new features that make it worth the change.
Outlook --  horrible.  freezes constantly and seldom opens correctly the fist time (I'm writing this review as I wait for Outlook to try and open for the sixth consecutive time).  more difficult to assign categories to calendar entries via shortcut keys.  Again, I haven't found any features that offset the drawbacks.
Office has a "print to .pdf" add in.  This is good.  However, you can get the same funcitonality by downloading CutePDF for free.  The headaches of Office 2007 are not worth it.  
by the way, I have always been a fan of Office products is the past.  This upgrade was a waste.  Actually, it has negative value becuase of the time I waste every time I use it.

I've had a Solo for 17 months (purchased from Amazon on 10/1/2007).  It worked fine for almost 15 months, then a firmware upgrade occurred and the box has been flaky ever since.  Slingmedia has a notice on their support site that this is a known problem (the notice has been there for at least 2 months).  But they admit they can't solve it.

I just bought a new computer that runs on Vista.  Installation of TurboTax was impossible.  I kept getting the UNHANDLED EXCEPTION 0x80040707 ERROR.  I went to the TurboTax support site for help.  The information they provided did not solve the problem and the only available next step was to submit my email address.  The Quicken reply message was not helpful and only stated that they will email me when they have a solution to the problem.  Cold comfort for someone who bought the product that is supposed to be Vista compatible.  Shame on you, Quicken!
FYI...I installed it on Windows XP without any problem eventhough it did take quite a long time for the installation.  So, if you have Vista, perhaps you should find another tax prep product.

I am a huge fan of the founding fathers, and did not think there was any way that this series would disappoint me.  However, the story was dull outside of the real life large events.  The actors did not perform as well as other series and films in done in this era.  I very rarely give extremely poor reviews, but this series was just a disappointment from the first episode to the last.
On the other hand, for anyone that knows history, I love Alexander Hamilton, and this series makes him look very bad.  So, my opinion may be slightly skewed, but I found very little to like about this series.
Best Wishes.

I've had this for less than a year(9 months), and I'd say I use it about 2-4 times a week.  It doesn't work properly anymore.  I guess there is a shortage in the cord or something.  Some times it doesn't turn on, and I have to wiggle the cord and hold it in a certain direction for it to work.  Of course, as others stated.. if you buy it online/amazon, the warranty is VOID, so I'm going to have to buy a new one.

Yes the product is awkward to hold and operate at first but you can get use to that.  My problem is it does not get close enough to the skin.  I do not want any visible hair in my nose, and this product does not cut close enough to the skin to avoid this.  Furthermore, they claim that the product does not pull hair, but it does.

I purchased this product thinking that it would revolutionize my financial organization -but I should have known better after I have started to read all of the product reviews.
I can't even give a thorough review, since I can't seem to get past even downloading my savings &amp; checking information from my bank.  The incorrect balances are showing, and the register doesn't show all of the transactions that my banking website shows.

I've just spent over 45 minutes on an online "chat" - which was more of a waste of time than anything.  The customer's support suggestions pretty much entailed deleting files, restarting, deleting files, restarting.
10 minutes ago, he wrote this:

I too, wanted to love this camera.  Boots up fast, lightweight, great price, works great w/imovie 09.  Problem was poor indoor picture quality, very pixelly.  I did not even try it outside because the indoor quality was so bad, i just boxed it up and sent it back.  Bought from J&amp;R, had no problem returning it, it just cost me $15 to return with insurance of course.  Great camera for internet video or just for youtube.  I can't believe this camera has gotten a four star average. I guess most of the reviewers have never had a digital camcorder.  Not even close to MiniDV quality. I guess I will have to spring for the HF100.

I got this shaver for a Christmas gift from my fiance. I read all the reviews online and on Men's Health and decided to get this instead of the Phillips.
Let me start by saying that I have VERY sensitive skin.
This razor did nothing like all the ads states. It was a rough shave. Had to go over my face numerous times and even dig the razor into the the neck to get at some whiskers.
It left my face red and bumpy and my skins burned for hours after the shave.
I ultimately returned it to Braun being very disappointed and now am searching for a new razor and looking at the new Phillips.
I would NOT recommend this shaver to anyone-especially if you have a soft sensitive face and skin.
Sorry Braun....Sorry Amazon but I am just being very honest to try and help the other consumers who may look at this.
Hope this helps......

I bought this laptop because of its portability and attractiveness. The configuration seemed to be good enough for my business, but it didn't. The first thing I want to mention here is the CPU. Be careful! You can be cheated, as I was, by the 1.6mHz CPU chip: it's not Intel or other brandnames, it's VIA and damn it! It's the worst CPU I have experienced in my life: warm up so fast and very very slow. I don't know why HP didn't put in there an Intel Atom chip, which is much more reasonable for a portable device like this.
Secondly, the pre-installed Vista business really makes you crazy by its speed. It takes you at least 2 minites to boot up the machine and it forces the fan to work always at the highest capacity. Some people say it needs to be downgraded to WinXP, but why HP didn't do that for the customers? Because not everyone can do that with ease!
In short, I think this mini-notebook would be great if HP gets rid of the VIA chip and put in the Intel Atom, and replace Vista with XP.
Anyway, I returned my notebook only one day after I'd received it! Bad purchase.

It was a cute movie but the political overtones to the movie were hard to accept. Without giving away the movie, I just don't buy the basic premise that the movie starts with and certainly not the ending. Realistically, you have to be pretty depressed or hopeless to create this kind of storyline. It might be ok for kids who won't get the political part but otherwise not recommended.

This company in their infinite wisdom gave this unit the SAME address as the common ATandT yahoo modem. To correct this problem hook up the modem with the router and sign on to the internet, but wait...they dont work together because of the conflict. You therefore cant sign on with them hooked up to correct the problem. Does this sound circular? There is a customer support line for you to call LONG DISTANCE and be on hold for half an hour or better at YOUR expense. There you get someone that has learned a years worth of ENGLISH from a book so cant understand what you are saying. After several minutes of them not being able to understand your questions, they drop connection. You can either get BACK in the customer support line...on hold...long distance at YOUR expense, or throw the item in the trash. Please dont waste your money. Before you buy ANY router, please go to its support page. See if your DSL provider is listed there with NUMEROUS complaints. Though to be fair, I can understand how small the company AT and T is and therefore why THIS company hasnt bothered to put out a product that does not conflict. Also be aware that their web site has BLATENTLY written "We give NO refunds for ANY reason". Now if this unit were NOT such a problem why would they NEED to write that! Please ignore the GLOWING reviews written by employees of this company and go see their web page for yourself. BEWARE! The company doesnt give refunds so Im essentially throwing over a hundred bucks in the trash. Wanna join me or you wanna pass this by?

I know the movie itself is terrific, but the Seller sold me a pirated copy after telling me it was new.  It worked the first 2 times then after it skipped, or froze up, or wouldn't play at all.  Then a screen came up then I knew it was a copy.  The disc's center [hole] was crumbling and scratches galore.
The Seller has shut down his storefront and has disappeared.  "Shutuploli" was his handle and he is in Chicago.  Others
 had the same problem with him and he does not answer his e-mail.  He was a new Merchant and I wanted to give him a chance. 
I wrote to Amazon and fortunately they will refund my money after an investigation.

I like to relax with something fun after a tough day at the office, after hearing all the news about the hurricane, all the news about the terrorism, and all the news about the war. It's always nice to come home to my family, unwind, and enjoy a nice Science Fiction escape every so often. I can't do that with this series. I see from this board that fans of the new series often consider fun shows like the original BSG to be "garbage" and those who don't like the new version to be "live in their parent's basement types". That simply isn't true. I embrace reality. I'm a fan of many older TV programs and do not consider them garbage. I also like newer TV series although this isn't one them. Not everybody considers this to be "a treat". Not liking this new BSG doesn't indicate that a person doesn't live in the real world. They could very well live in the real world and that's why they like entertainment they can escape and unwind with at times. I sure do. New BSG isn't that kind of program. The September 11th elements of this series are bad enough, but that's not the end of it. It then goes on to use the war in Iraq as fodder for what some call "fun" and "a treat" that we should "enjoy". No thanks.

Braun says that these blades work with the 8595 that I use. While it's true that the blades do fit and the razor will operate, the level of razor burn is OFF THE SCALE compared to the Activator blades. The best thing about the Braun system is the minimal to non-existent razor burn, an advantage that is completely lost with these. If you use an 8595, avoid these blades like the plague.

Like the other books in the Twilight series, the story was creative and interesting and character development was strong. However, those are the only good things about the books. In my opinion, I thought this final book in the Twilight Saga had the most flaws. One example was Bella. I've noticed that she doesn't have any self concern for herself, and it's even more clear in this book. After she had sex with Edward, he accidently gave her bruises all over. Instead of thinking about the danger, she got pissed because Edward's concern for her was ruining her fun. Even worse, she kept begging him for more sex and even wept about it, until he gave in. This showed how selfish she was and how far she would go to get what she wanted. She did not use logic, and all she thought about was sex. She even wanted to postpone the date of her transformation into a vampire because of sex. I guess the author was trying to say that sex is the only good thing about being human. That's a rotten message. So my point, I guess, is that there's nothing good about Bella, and is a bad role model. She was so selfish and whiny, I believe that Edward loved her only because she was the only person whose mind he couldn't read, which made her stand out from everyone else.
Secondly, Bella's pregnancy shouldn't have occurred. Stephanie said that vampires were completely filled with venom, so there was no way Edward could have gotten Bella pregnant. This indicated that Stephanie wasn't a good writer, because she was breaking her own rules. Vampires don't even have tears, yet male vampires have sperm? It doesn't make any sense.
I also agreed with some of the other reviewers that Bella got everything she wanted without much of a problem. This was unrealistic, because people have to fight for some things in order to gain them. But Bella easily got everything she wanted. A baby, which I already said shouldn't have existed based on Stephanie's rules about vampires (but probably included to make Bella and Rosalie happy) and the ability to have excellent self control and can be around humans. Yes, Stephanie Meyer used the excuse that Bella had better self control because she was aware of the conflicts of being a vampire, but she still would have suffered immense thirst when she became a newborn, which was natural. But no, Meyer made Bella have a lot better self control than most other vampires, so as to make her happy and still talk to Charlie. Like I said, unrealistic. 
So all in all, I thought this book was a disappointment. It has poor literary value. So if you want to read it, have fun but don't be influenced by everything Stephanie Meyer writes, because some parts are trash.

  Cover flow is nice
  Accelerometer is cool for games

  Battery life not as good as 2g (probably because of the larger display)
  Scroll wheel not as accurate or responsive as 2g scroll wheel (wheel feels like it is made out of flimsy material).

My original purchase failed within 30 days and Amazon sent out a replacment at no charge.  Unfortunatly the replacement failed 45 days later, which meant I am stuck with a defective product.  VERY DISAPPOINTING!!

Please! DO NOT waste your money buying this moronic drivel. It's all very pretty but it's what Hollywood "entertainment" has become: irretrievably STUPID, dumbed-down eye candy, sound and fury signifying NOTHING. And Nicole Kidman is the reigning queen of embarassing, overwrought, paint-by-numbers "acting". Calling this film BORING would be rewarding this 2 and 1/2 hour load with heaping praise.
This movie (I only rented it, fortunately) is SO bad I could stomach only about 30 minutes of it before fleeing in despair that American movie-making could sink this low in its furious quest for a big-dollar ROI. The cartoonish beginning was an early tipoff: "Help! Not another
idiotic, two-dimensional Indiana Jones clone!" But sure enough....
This is the absolute perfect vehicle for a generation that thinks watching "The Simpsons" is time well spent. Toss this clunker into the Hollywood Cultural Sinkhole along with 99% of everything else it foists upon a gullible, apathetic audience. Don't soil your consciousness on this "Zero stars" nonsense. You'll be sorry.

I've been using Office 2007 since early January 07 and am still struggling  to locate Excel and Word commands that I use to be able to execute in split seconds while drinking coffee and talking on the phone. While some of the deeper functions are now more up front with this revamped format, the side affect is that the top level command interface is now significantly diluted with all the infrequently used features and functions. What really I miss in Office 2007 is no longer being able to use many of the common key-stroke commands, and being able to modify the Toolbar (now called "The Ribbon") interface from within the application.  I really liked being able to customize the toolbars in previous versions of Word and Excel according to my own needs. While previous versions of "Office" had their problems, this latest version, so far, has definitely been a drag on my productivity.

I've had 2 of these... not because I love it so much but because I had the first replaced. 
I bought the first one and loved it for almost a year. The brew interrupt (water flow temporarily stops so you can grab a cupful) stopped working but as long as guests knew to wait until the pot finished I didn't care too much. Then one morning I came down to a flooded countertop (piping broke). I called Cuisinart (no easy task) and finally arranged to ship it back (at my expense ((they wanted UPS)) and including a $10 check for a replacement). Cuisinart promptly cashed my check but didn't send the promised replacement. After a month I called to check and was told that they didn't have any in stock. ??? Stores were full of them but the manufacturer didn't have any. I was also told that it was "company policy" to cash the check immediately, but that they had no idea whan I'd receive a replacement. Another month went by and the replacement finally appeared. Yeah. A month later the brew interrupt on the new one stopped working (big shock there ;-) and now I'm loosing so much water to steam that 12 cups of water nets me 7-8 cups of coffee, and time from start of brew until finish (i.e. when you can get a cup without coffee spilling everywhere) has increased from ~5 minutes to 30 minutes. *sigh* I'm looking around for a replacement since the warranty only applied to the original (not the replacement) and I would have to pay for the next one myself. I just know it won't be a Cuisinart.

SPOILERS:
Let me say that I loved Twilight. However, I was seriously perplexed with the direction of New Moon and Eclipse. Honestly there are so many other plots you can concern yourself with then making a love triangle and the various subplots it can proliferate. I really hated it and I was wondering how SM was going to resolve her love creation. 
This book was about 3 books in one, and it showed. BD was a departure into a bit more adult situations, which is refeshing bc sometimes I was so frustrated with the sexual buildup in the previous books or tweeny situations. Of course SM builds us up again in BD, and the characters finally get to do it, but then thats it, fade to black. Almost as if she did write the whole scene, but then hacked off the middle gooey parts. Even though I know she can't go into the nuts and bolts of sex, the act can be described in a vague way but still thorough. Oh well. 
I am a Vampire girl. I read Anne Rice, Laurel K Hamilton, encyclopedia of vampires, tons of stuff. There are things you do and things you don't do. Honestly, I was gettting more upset through the series bc these supernatural things were really beyond imagination and just plain senseless. It seemed SM just made up stuff as she went along, and then contradicted herself later on. 
Bella pregnant? How? Where the hell did this come up before in the other books? So Edward's sperm was frozen for about 80 years till he decides to use it? Her plot devices were grossly oversimplified. 
And, now Jake imprints on Reneesme (don't get me started on the name). Gee, SM wrapped that love triangle up like a bow. How did I know this was going to happen. Way to convenient and yes just a little strange. 
But, in truth, BD had more action, and more character development, Bella does think about something besides Edward, Jake or herself. I was happy to see her in a motherly role and let's face it, the powers of her new found vampirism are logical. 
All in all, it was a fitting conclusion to an ill-conceived series. She should shy away from series whether she does young adult or adult fiction.
I would have gone a completely different way, but alas Im not SM.

This was to be my first wireless network.  Yahoo!!!
The router detected my cable modem and I locked it down tight in admin. All was well for 2 weeks.  Then it just died, just quit transmitting and receiving.  I reset it, yada, yada yada...  After 2 more hours with "Mike" from India, he pronounced the unit dead.  "Take it back to Best Buy!" says he.
I exchanged it for another, which lasted 30 days, then did the same thing!  I did not waste time on another one, just hooked my laptop back up to the cable modem and called it good.  Goodbye, Linksys...

I juice pretty much every day, about 2 grapefruits a day. I have had this juicer for less than a year and a few months after buying it, I am ready to trash it. In the beginning it worked fine but now whenever I try to use it, the motor catches and pauses frequently and makes a weird grinding noise before it will start rotating and juicing again. So it takes a long time to juice anything, and the noise is very irritating. I guess to get a truly durable product that works seamlessly, I will need to spend a lot more. I guess this is good if you are not into frequent/heavy juicing.

I upgraded my Linksys 802.11b (which always worked fine) to this "g" model for the improved speed.  I have been disappointed with its performance.  Initially, I noticed it was SLOWER than my old router.  After reading reviews on the internet (which I should have done before I bought it) I learned of many complaints about version 5.  I hurried to my office and flipped over the router and there it was, v.5 on the bottom.  Reading on, I learned about the firmware updates so I downloaded them which helped improve the speed a bit.  Now, the problem is streaming video.  With my old router, I used to be able to watch movie trailers and other streaming feeds.  This v.5 stutters and locks up the video.  If I can't resolve this problem I will likely find another router.

Potential customers using Windows Vista or XP should be advised that these disks have been preformatted for Mac and will need to be reformatted for the Windows file format (NTFS). The instructions for reformatting the disks are buried deep inside the User's Guide (page 29). 
What is worse, if you are using Windows XP and follow these formatting instructions, the format will fail. Only the quick-format option (which is not recommended as it will not run a disk check) will work. In fact, neither Windows disk check nor disk defragmentation will work. A workaround for defragmentation is to install another disk defrag software. I successfully tried Auslogics (freeware). 
The disks are delivered with three sets of cables: (1) USB; (2) 6-to-6-pin (Firewire 400/IEEE 1394a) and (3) 9-to-9-pin (Firewire 800/IEEE 1394b). If your computer (like most PC notebooks) has a 4-pin Firewire jack, you will need to purchase a cable or adapter (costs about $30) separately. 
LaCie offers support if you register the product. The communications take place through a cgi-bin on their website; they will not call you on the phone. Their attitude has been helpful, which is nice, but didn't solve the technical problem. 
The bottom line is that LaCie seems to have launched this product fully aware of the existence of this problem, but have chosen not to advise Windows XP users of it. 
The latest word from LaCie is that they are working on a solution; there is no telling when it will be solved. Until such time that LaCie comes up with a solution, Windows XP users are strongly advised to avoid this product altogether. I will update this review if and when LaCie solves the problem and notifies their customers about it.

I really enjoyed this small &amp; beautiful mp3 player but only for 3 months. Something inside (maybe the battery) bursted!! causing the case to bend and crack open!! :(

<review id="1075" label="0">
The special purpose buttons are preset mostly to media functions (eject, play/pause) and document functions (copy, paste, etc.). Most of the backlighting bleeds between the keys, and the function keys barely light up at all.
Basic keyboard functions such as sleep are absent and cannot be added to using the included software. Microsoft's more basic media keyboard has more special keys as well as having five programmable keys that are easier to program.
The main defect of the Reclusa is that the extra keys are full size and sit too close to the standard keys, making it easy to hit them by mistake. This was particularly the case with the Eject button which is right next to the numeric keypad's Enter key.
The key faces are flatter and some will find this less comfortable.
Apart from the USB ports, this keyboard does not have much else to recommend it. I sent mine back for a refund.

My dog is easy  to groom, so she let me use this almost immediately. She is a small dog, so her nails are not big or thick, but it took forever to see any reduction in length. If I put a bit of pressure on it to speed things along, it quits turning. I would send it back if I had kept the box (big mistake). So now I clip her nails the old-fashioned way. I'm thinking of turning this into a small hand-held fan or something useful.

Frankly I'm dumbfounded by the positive reviews here. This was pure flimsy plastic junk and I just returned it. It didn't work for me at all. It shaved about 10% of what I asked it to, and no matter how many times I went over certain spots this thing could not hack it. Also, according to the cheaply done instructions, it can be overcharged if you don't unplug it. Hello? What year is this? A little more sophistication please! I suppose if you are accustomed to shoddy poorly made products you'll find this thing acceptable. Definitely one to avoid.

Yawn.... if you think real weddings are boring, try sitting through scene after scene of toasts, smiling kissy face or teary face bride and groom, overly looooong and contrived scenes such as the one involving a contest between the groom and the bride's father to see who can load the dishwasher the fastest-which was only used as a plot device to sneak in a child's plate ( I do not want to give it away) ... I could not believe this movie has been touted as so exceptional. There were some clever scenes but few and far between.
We have seen this before- 20 something screwed up misunderstood waif with a heart of gold who does not take any responsibility for herself ..oh yes she is in rehab but merely uses it as an excuse for more pity. Ann Hathaway was OK, certainly better in this than she was in Brokeback Mountain or that horrid Prada movie, but this seems to be the kind of part pretty actresses get raves over- smoke, sulk, have bad hair and smeary makeup, and act out for attention. I do not think it is Oscar worthy but she is the It Girl of the Moment and will probably get the award. 
Had there been more meat to the story and less blabbering toasts and scenes of partying guests dancing, had the great and underused Debra Winger been able to actually have a stronger role in this movie, especially since she was the pivotal cause of Kym's ( Ann Hathaway) pain, it would have been interesting.  The father was featured way more than necessary... he was a super co dependent which was hammered in over and over. Yea, I got it. After learning about the dad, I wanted to know more about the Debra Winger character especially given that she was so important a factor  I would have loved more scenes with her and actually less scenes with the bride Rachel. 
Also, whenever Debra Winger was on the screen, man, her charisma and star power is still there, I swear! Hollywood, give that woman another movie to star in would you!? 
The great stage actress Anna Devere Smith should have been given more to do than smile or get teary eyed, there could have been some deeper scenes with her, how she was fitting into this family, but we did not get deeper with her either. This was a movie that didn't know what it wanted to say beyond the cliches. And a movie that needed a lot of pruning and editing!
I will say it was fantastic to see a movie with a multicultural cast, although they were each so earnest and artsy I got the feeling the Lumet and Demme families had gathered up all their indie friends to party. Good music.
The movie  had that naturalistic style so many movies from the 70s had, I wondered if writer Jenny Lumet's dad's influenced her ( Her dad is the great Sidney Lumet, which also had me wondering if that was how such a self indulgent script got made into a movie). 
A huge plus was the cinematography, each scene was completely beautiful, I will say. A visual treat. I did not know beforehand about the handheld camera work and for some reason, I did not get nauseous or dizzy, it really did not bother me, in fact I did like it-The sets were exceptionally captivating. The scenery , the houses were lovely, Connecticut looked magical. Even the gosh-awful toasts and party scenes were made watchable by the cinematography. The wedding cake was spectacular. Fast forward to that part.

After much research, I ordered this because of all of the great reviews I've read here and elsewhere...didn't work for me.  I tried 3 different espressos from 3 different sources--all ground for espresso--one even ground extra fine and the espresso pulled came out weak every time, with just a little crema.  I don't know if I got a jinxed machine or what, but it just wouldn't work.  And Amazon just keeps raising the price on the little wonder.  It's gone from $79.99 to over 100.00 over the past month alone.  I sent mine back for a refund.  I might try one from a department store to see if the problem was just the one I got from Amazon.

Breaking Dawn was such a huge disappointment.  I really loved Meyer's other three novels, so when Breaking Dawn came out, I was first in line...well, not really.  But I did go out and buy it the next day.
Meyer has broken a cardinal rule of writing: you can't have it all.  A character with no consequences to their actions makes for a very boring read.  I don't like to see people hurting; but characters just tra-la-la-laing through the novel is dull.
There were also quite a few weird scences that I won't completely give up for those who haven't read it: broken bed and weird baby...but that's all that I will give away.
It's a must read for thos who have read the previous three books.  But it's not at all like I expected.  But not in a good way.

I purchased a new Aspire 5100 and it broke within 8 months of normal use. Dealing with Tech Support was a nightmare. I have, all told, spent over 12 hours on the phone with those people, mostly waiting on hold. First, all repairs are done in Texas and the expense to send broken items lies with the customer. They repaired it, returned it to me, and it had an entirely new set of problems. I sent it back. They repaired it, returned it to me, and on day 89 of the 90 day warranty it broke again. This was on a Saturday when Tech support is closed. I called on Monday and they claimed that the warranty had expired but that they would look at it if I first paid them $400 up front for "out of warranty service" and shipped it Texas yet again.
DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! BE SURE TO PURCHASE A PRODUCT THAT HAS A RELIABLE AND DECENT SUPPORT TEAM AND POLICY.

Here are two things Phillips will not tell you about their Sonicare toothbrushes and heads. 
1) The collar that holds the toothbrush to the handle will disintegrate in a couple of months. That's what prompted this review, because they would not replace mine after it fell apart two weeks after purchasing a replacement. 
They manufacturer these things to disintegrate so you will continue to buy replacements - planned obsolescence. However, I suspect their China supplier is skimping on the plastic specifications and they fall apart in weeks instead of months. (Do you think China would really do that?)
2) UNPLUG your base until you need to charge the toothbrush.  If you charge it up overnight, then unplug the base, the toothbrush will work for four brushings per day for about a month.  Then, when it signals or stops, plug the base in to charge it. 
This method will allow your toothbrush to work for five years or longer. If you keep the base plugged in all the time, these NiCad batteries develop memory and will stop functioning after 18 to 24 months.
A bonus, if you travel a lot as I do, you don't have to pack the charger.  Just make sure it's topped off and you're good for a month's vacation.

I bought this to replace my aging MiniDV ZR200, and thought that stepping up to the newest format would be a good step since I copy the videos to my computer and then burn them to DVD.  I loved the MiniDV format, but thought that this would be a good move since I could hear the tape motor in the background on my old camera, and with flash there are no moving parts.  Bad idea... I got it in hand, charged the battery for 12 hours and then fired it up and the image quality was terrible.  I have a cheap Canon SD1000 digital camera (Which I absolutely love) that can take short movies, and it blows away the videos I got from the FS100.  Also the five year old ZR200 can record short videos to it's flash card, and that video is again far far better than anything I got with this FS100.  At first everything was good, I could see the wall, floor, etc.  But then my son walked in and asked me what it was, and as he talked and moved around the image ghosted so bad you could not recognize him at all until he stopped moving.  I had bought a brand new class 6 SanDisk SD card for it, so it is the best flash card money can buy right now so that's not the issue. Bright light, dim light, different flash cards from other cameras etc. etc. and still no change. After playing with it for two hours and reading the entire English section of the manual I boxed it back up and shipped it back to Amazon and bought the ZR950 MiniDV camcorder instead.  It's image quality is incomparable to the trash I got from the FS100, and it is $100 less to boot.  The one thing that amazed me the most was walking into my kitchen and simply panning side to side about once a second for a bit.  As the image moved the camera dropped to maybe 5 frames a second at best, and then came back up to a more acceptable frame rate once it stopped, while blurring out everything in the frame as it moved.  Maybe in a few more years they will have the flash format to the point where it can be useful, but it is not there yet.  If you want video quality that is on par with a cell phone or cheap web cam, this is your camera.  If you want a camera to record birthdays and vacations to watch on TV later you will be disappointed.

I gave this one star mainly to bring attention to a common MBP problem.  My MBP arrived with a dead pixel(s) near the top.  It would have been such a hassle to send it back I figured I would deal with it and maybe take it to a Mac store it became bothersome.  I learned that Apple does not consider this to be "Materially Defective" because it is not in the main viewing area of the screen.  If you go to the Mac Blogs and other threads you will see many people with this problem.  My suggestion is to immediately see if the screen has any pixels that are either dead or stuck and return it to Amazon if you do.  Amazon will treat you better than Apple.  They will send you a shipping label and replace the MBP where as Apple will not cover the defective screen as they do not consider it a defect.  In all other ways I am very happy with the MBP as I am a convert from Dell.

Okay so i was all excited to get my copy of Breaking Dawn on the midnight release. I thought it would be so much better than the other 3. Sadly, I was mistaken, HORRIBLY mistaken.
Heres the main thing about Breaking Dawn that pissed me off:
WHERE THE HELL IS THE PLOT!?
Yes i know it has hot guys, passion, love, sex and all that jazz, but wheres the plot? Around the second half of Bella's book 3, it started to feel very compressed, rushed, and boring. I think while SM was writing this she remembered that she forgot a plot and just started to throw a bunch of things together to make something. It got so confusing in the end, I had to read it three times to get it. Reading it often felt like a chore.
Somehow, I managed to finish it and quickly picked up Wuthering Heights so i can completely forget about Breaking Dawn. 
I was so disappointed, I hyped up and lost like 4 hours of precious sleep for this. 
Now I'm not saying that SM is a bad writer, (actually her other novel, The Host, is 15x better than the entire Twilight Saga) its just Breaking Dawn, it was just, *sigh*.

It's a good camera for the price and it's easy to use. The problem is in downloading the files. Files get so big that it freezes my PC (my PC is new and super-fast) if I download all the files at once. I had to download on groups of smaller files to make it work but takes a long time. Also, once you unplugged Flip from the PC, the Flip screen still shows "Connected", and the power button couldn't turn the unit off. I had to remove the batteries in order to shut it down. The problem doesn't seem to go away everytime I download files. It's cheap but I thought I wasted my money buying it.

The whole joystick worked well for a short while (2-3 months) until it started going off center.  You can watch it go off center (Windows XP) in the control panel and see what your range of use is without being able to correct it in any way.  The only way to recalibrate is to unplug/plug back in.  Sometimes works...most times doesn't.  Gets VERY jittery and forces you to use a high x/y dead zone.  Throttle and twist never gave me problems.It would be a great joystick if it didn't break so fast.

I'm with an animal rescue group so we have a lot of cats.  Needless to say we loved the original Drinkwell because it attracts the cats over to drink more water.  The new design of the Platinum Drinkwell is even better as far as attracting the cats... however, there are a couple of design flaws which are making these more work for us.  The reservoir cannot stand up independently like the old one.  You have to hold it or lean it against something sturdy in order to refill it as it is curved shape.  Additionally, when we flip it back over no matter how careful we are water leaks out.  The opening to the reservoir and shape of it also do not allow for easy cleaning.  The only new feature we like a lot is the little "gate" in front of the motor area which helps us keep cat hair and fuzzies out.  A plus to any Drinkwell would be if the top of the unit actually snapped into place and could not be removed by the animals.  We find the cats think the top of this is a new toy and they bat it all over the house - we have had to remove it entirely - which unfortunately only leads to more hair / fuzzies being able to get into the unit.  As a rescue we refill the Drinkwells 2 or 3 times a day and while we like the Platinum one because it holds more water the fact that we can't stand the reservoir up by itself is a deterrent.  We won't be purchasing more of them and will probably go back to using the original version.

I am very disappointed with this product.  It is a great concept -- brewing a single serving into a thermal mug.  However, it doesn't work well, at least not for me.  The hot water is expressed very forcefully into the filter basket where the coffee grounds are.  So much so that it scatters the grounds throughout the entire inside of the product -- into the water reservoir and into the brewed coffee.  Cleaning this mess up is a real drag.  You end up with a cup of hot coffee that is filled with coffee grounds.

Outlook with Business Contact Manager is a misnomer. BCM is in reality a bolt-on application that works alongside Outlook with a similar file structure. This would be a fine arrangement except that Outlook and BCM do not integrate together. For example, contacts with the same name in both Outlook and BCM are different contacts and do not share information nor do they synchronize in any way. I use a hosted Outlook Exchange service that keeps my desk and mobile email and contacts synchronized. When I moved a contact from Outlook to BCM I lost visibility of that contact through Exchange and the contact became visible only through my desktop. This is an unacceptable backward step. I just wasted the hundred bucks I spent on the Outlook with BCM application. As best I can tell, the best contact manager/CRM systems are now the web 2.0/hosted applications such as Salesforce, Zoho, Sugar, etc. I suggest using one of them. Good luck.

Unfortunately, Norelco really messed up what they had right to begin with. The length adjustment does not snap into place like my old Norelco trimmer and will shift while you are shaving. If you want to get a clean shave, go ahead and purchase this product, because that is exactly what you will have to do after using it. Disappointing build quality!

When we heard about this blanket, we were very excited.  Our daughter loves to be swaddled, when we get it right - however, the blankets that we have (even the ones that the hospital used to swaddle her) were not very helpful for easy swaddling.  And she works herself loose because she's getting stronger every day.
We hoped a blanket cut for swaddling with the velcro would be the solution...
However, two problems:
1.  It doesn't fit properly and she works herself loose despite the velcro - the velcro contact patches are very small - there should be a broader strip of velcro to attach to so it is more adjustable.   Our daughter is small, and it is just too big on her.  She swims in it.  We hope it will work better when she gets bigger.
2.  Fleece - decent winter solution, but terrible in the summer.  And terrible if you keep your house over 60 degrees.  If only it came in a lighter material (we haven't found it).
Oh well...  it definitely seems to work for some, so don't use our review as your only basis.
THAT BEING SAID, HOWEVER, we now (as of yesterday) use a large waffle weave blanket from Target (~$5) and it works wonderfully...  we can wrap it tight, and she does work herself loose after about 3 hours, but it is better than any of the previous solutions.  We also just ordered the Amazing Miracle Blanket to try (another swaddling blanket), which came highly recommended.
One other note about swaddling - whenever she has been properly swaddled (usually by an expert) she loves it...  We initially told some folks who have a lot of experience with children that she liked to have her arms loose.  the response we got is that most babies behave that way, and it really is the small minority of babies that don't really like swaddling.  Now that we know how to do it properly, we would agree.

It is simply inconceivable how bad Ooma's customer service is. I signed up at the beginning of January. Two months in, and they still have not ported my primary number (which means I'm paying both AT&amp;T for continued service and Ooma for their so-called premier service). 
I've submitted more than a dozen emails to customer support and have never received a single response from a human. A request for a tier-two technical support call-back was promised within the hour.  That was three weeks ago.  Since mid-February, their customer support line has either been continually busy or simply unanswered. Their system lets you sit on hold for 30 minutes and then automatically hangs up on you. I tried three successive times last week for a total of 90 minutes on hold only to be kicked off all three times. 
There is simply no excuse for this. None.   Stay far, far away from this product.

I bought this item when my daughter was 9 months old.  It was only good for few days.  When she learned to stand,  she also learned to climb it!  Her toes fits perfectly on the holes.  I put on her shoes, but then she had a strong grip and uses her hands and pull herself up or hangs on it.  Manufacturer should redesign this item, by making its poles into horizontal like most gates, and not the diamond shape holes.  This product is only good for infants learning to crawl, but not when they learn to stand... and figure out that they can climb it too!  I would say this product is only appropriate for 0-9 months old; those who are learning to crawl; and those infants who cannot stand yet.

This review is from: High School Musical 3: Senior Year (DVD)
      
'Cuz this movie reeks!!  Anyone with half a brain can see that Disney has shamefully resurrected the clich�d teenage musical films of the 70's that make real people sick to their stomaches.  At nearly two hours this vomit-inducing garabage heap will only appeal to na�ve, preppy tweens with nothing better to do than sponge off their parents money or gullable soccer moms, who instead of sitting around with their Hannah Montana clones all day, should be looking for a job.
With the innovating title "High School Musical" we follow the same politically correct ensamble of so-called actors from the first two installments into their senior year of high school.  This cast of perfect little dittoheads then sing and dance their way through all the lame problems of their senior year and graduate.
Are you sure somebody didn't fart?  'Cuz this reeks BAD!

I have used TurboTax for a number of years. I've never been crazy about its unintuitive interface and limited error checking  -- I had to refile last year because TurboTax did not flag a fairly obvious omission. I never had this problem when I was using a simple spread sheet to compute my taxes. Nonetheless, I had been sticking with it because I had figured out their idiosyncrasies and liked  the tax year carry forward feature. I had even signed up for their "TurboTax Advantage" program where they claim to send TurboTax for " low direct-from-Intuit price" for which Intuit charges substantially more than you can buy it from Amazon or a local retailer. My most recent bill showed a charge of $63.55. 
I'll be switching to another product, probably H&amp;R Block's Tax Cut which is less expensive and also includes state tax preparation. Failing that, I'll go back to using a spreadsheet. Goodbye Intuit!

The Chi is not for people who have already gotten used to their old hair straightener, especially if the old one is of a good brand. But first-timers will be amazed by the ability of the Chi.
Although the box says that the Chi straightens, flips, styles, and curls, all the Chi really does is straighten.
It works only slightly better than the regular, drugstore, cheaper hair straighteners.

This is absolutely absurd, it was true that Slumdog Millionaire was a good movie but people are getting hyped up on a movie that wasn't exceptional.

I would give it a minus star if you had one to check off. It is so slow. I thought I was back in the 15 MHz CPU era. It is only good for copying small files at a time, hence why would I even use a 32 GB for them? I might as well be using a 512 MB drive instead. I went ahead and bought two 16 GB drives instead and they serve my purpose much better.

This review is from: Transformers (Two-Disc Special Edition) [HD DVD] (HD DVD)
      
Transformers has great potential and some moments that show you it could've been so much more than it turned out to be and yet it disappoints by what it mostly is. There truly is more than meets the eye to this film but I don't really like what I see.
Transformers falls victim to being another typical Hollywood project that's chock full of the standard thoughts and beliefs of a humanistic, secular and liberal society. Michael bay and company stuffed this film with so much Hollywood fluff that the story about the Transformers broke under the weight of it. There are so many places where this movie goes wrong. 
First, it focuses waaaaay too much on everyone else in the film except the actual Transformers. The movie is called Transformers isn't it? We're not given much of any story, background or character on the Transformers themselves. There's almost no connection to the old 80's cartoon and the most history we get to see is in the form of a short flashback. They give us a hint of the conflict between Starscream and Megatron but couldn't give anymore because the movie ran so long on human stories. There's just so much time wasted on the human characters that we're not here to see. If you take out Megan Fox and her character altogether, the movie becomes instantly better. I didn't put down my money to see how hot the director thinks she is with the close up shots of her or to see another movie about teenage romance. About them getting to know each other, getting past their differences and falling in love. I really don't want to see it as I really don't care. Sam's parents are annoying and also get more time on screen than they have a right to. Even the soldiers are on for too long. I think there was so much confusion here as to how to build the humans around the robots that they ended up building the robots around the humans. As a kid, I was a huge fan of the cartoon in the 80's and the show did well enough with very little human interaction.
Second, it's obvious that the writers and director here are very leftist liberals who are bent on preaching their secular humanism. Here are a few of the things I picked up on. Sam's mother asks if he was masturbating in his room because he had it locked. She then proceed's to tell him that "it's ok" if he was. His parents then discover that a girl was hiding in his room and congratulate him for it. So it's ok for a teenage boy to have a girl alone with him in his bedroom with the door locked? Okay? Then there's a few instances that reflect an anti-government, anti-authority attitude, but then they still remain pro-military as is popular today. Plus a little knock at President Bush, (yeah we know who the voice is supposed to sound like), and it's always popular to mock and insult him. Add to that the fact that the only person wearing a cross is the most unlikable character in the movie and it's readily apparent where the people behind this movie are coming from. Before you tell me "it's only a movie", don't deceive yourself into thinking that the media doesn't promote it's own ideas through it's mediums. Hollywood tells you exactly where it's coming from through t.v. and movies. I also didn't care for the cussing. They could've removed it altogether and it would'nt have changed a thing. The people involved in this movie know darn well that the audience will be a largely younger one. But I guess filthy language and sexuality are also some of our promoted and accepted traits in this country, so here they are. 
Third, they want to bring the Transformers into our world today but make alot of the people and situations unbelievable. I'd like to never see another movie where "joe nobody's" are suddenly allowed to be involved in a military resistance or are suddenly allowed to see and be included in the plans of top secret, underground, government agencies. Megan Fox's character isn't scared when she first sees a giant Decepticon coming right for her and Sam. She doesn't scream or freak out or anything. Not only that but when she and Sam are being chased by the smaller one, she immediately looks for a weapon to fight it, then does. Come on, are we really supposed to believe this? It's not only her though as it seems everyone wants to be the hero here and has no problem fighting with these giant alien robots that no one knows about. Everyone seems to just jump right into action. Like the earth is populated with superheroes. And they make Optimus Prime our biggest cheerleader. He's full of comments of how great we are and how they need us and couldn't achieve victory without us. Since when did the Autobots ever need us?
Fourth, They only got one of the original voice actors for the Transformers themselves. You could pull it off without most of them I guess but they should've got the originals or at least sound-a-likes for Megatron or Starscream, as they had classic and recognizable voices. I'm glad that they got Peter Cullen to reprise his role as the voice of Optimus but he should've been able to also do Ironhide as he used to.
Fifth, the product placement went to a new level of shameless with the cars and just about everything you see in the film. They could've used some clips of the movie for commercials.
Sixth, there are some moments here that just feel juvenile. The teen moments in school, at the park, with the parents, and the rock music on two of the action chases feel made for a teenage audience. Even as a young adult, I found them hard to sit through. And don't even get me started on the lame dialog. There's not a smart or insightful spoken word throughout.
The things I do like here are pretty obvious. I like the action, the graphics and the Transformers themselves. When they're on screen, the movie is alot more interesting and it makes you just want to see and learn more about them. Why didn't they just start the film with their war on their world, instead of just a flashback? It would've bee so much more interesting. This really should've been a straight up, sci fi action film. I accept the new look of the robots and the transforming animations are incredible.
Which brings me to the disc itself. I have seen both the standard and HD DVD versions and there's a pretty noticeble difference between them when comparing them. They're both very good though and your gonna be fine with either one you choose. The standard disc still looks and sounds very impressive. On a good t.v. and home theater, you won't feel like your missing out if you don't have the HD version. If you want the HD DVD version, which will be the same when it's released it on Blu-Ray, you'll want to have a very good HDTV and sound sysytem to make you happy you paid the extra money. It looks and sounds great to be sure but not so much that it makes the SD version look and sound bad. The 2 are actually pretty close and will equally satisfy.
I really wanted to like Transformers more than I do. But the things that bug me, really bug me. So much, that I find myself skipping through the slow, human story parts to get to the better stuff. That's not good. I don't own many, if any movies, where I have to do that. Those parts just bog the film down, make it longer and make it feel alot longer than it is. I hope they do better with the upcoming sequel, I don't think they will but here's to hoping. I give this one 2 stars for the effects studio who provided the excellent graphics and battle sequences, without those, it gets no stars. If you want a movie about uninteresting, stereotypical people (spineless loser guy, losers "cool" parents, ex thief/mechanic super girl, hip teen hackers, soft hearted military heroes, "evil" government) in unbelievable situations, sprinkled with some sci fi action in the form of robots, then you'll be happy. If you want sci fi action, something like the cartoons you may remember, and a smart and challenging film then your gonna struggle here. If your not a lefty liberal, looking for another celebration of secular humanism, your gonna struggle even more. If those things are a concern, rent before you buy.

I have used Braun shavers for over 15 years and I have loved them. Until now. After 4 years of great service my 7500 series Braun broke. With a track record like that, I was definitely buying another Braun. 
I figured a razor is something I should spend extra on since I use it every day, so I bought the very pricey 9595. I have come to regret it. It became clear early on that this one wasn't as good as the one that it replaced. After 3 months of daily use, I'm very frustrated and rather angry. 
- Noise. The pulsonic razor is really noisy. Much noisier than the 7500 series.
- Recharger/cleaner is very poorly designed. Rather than using a direct plug in connection, it has contacts on the razor and on the base that need to line up. This works until the razor starts cleaning, vibrating the razor. This causes it to lose connection and stop working. It normally takes four tries to get it to complete a cleaning cycle. There is no correct way to insert the shaver to guarantee it will complete  cleaning cycle. 
- Less information is less information. The old 7500 series told me how long the shave took and how much charge in minutes were left. The 9500 series has cell phone type bars for power and hygene, no read out on time taken to shave. After using this razor for 3 months, I think they removed the time taken to shave feature for a reason. 
- Takes too long to get all the missed spots. It takes 50% longer to get a good shave than with the 7500 series. 
- Excessive packaging. Packaging has no influence on those of us who buy through the Web, but I will note the packing is excessive and wasteful. 
- Gimmicky. I have noticed no benefits of "sonic" over a regular electric razor. 
After another time consuming shave and three attempts to get the razor to clean itself, I called customer service. They weren't very nice and wanted me to ship the charger to another city. Thanks for nothing. 
I have gone from a loyal Braun customer to someone who will never buy another Braun (or Proctor and Gamble marketed) electronic product. 
Update: I still hate this razor and the shaves have gotten even worse. It takes forever to shave with this thing. It is the worst shaver I have had in 18 years of shaving. I can't believe I paid over $200 for this POS.

Read the other reviews and you'll notice a trend. My controller lasted about one month before the right analog stick got uncallibrated. It makes my one game, MVP Baseball 2005, pointless since my players just dive around the field all day long.
What's sad is that this problem has been occurring in these controllers for over 3 years and they still keep on selling them. (Too bad I didn't read the reviews first.) Knowingly selling a defective product should be illegal. Shame on you logitech! Shame on you!

I'm a CA CPA who worked for a Big 4 Accounting firm.  I now work in Corporate Finance at a High Tech company.  I've been using TurboTax for about 10 years for my personal filings.  The software is good.  However, each year Turbotax tries to find a way to charge you more money.  You can't finish a return without getting asked at various points to spend more money.  
Most of the "in software" sales tactics are taking advantage of consumers' fear of taxes &amp; the IRS.  It makes people think that the software is a magic box.  The more you pay.  The more rock solid your return would be.
Further, telling consumers that they get federal and state returns and free e-file sounds good.  But, in the 2008 version, you have to pay for Sch D usage.  You have to pay for Sch C.  You have to pay to e-file state returns.  You have to pay for a 2nd state return.  They originally had you pay for printing your return.  Hidden fees are everywhere.  The idea that the various schedules within a tax return are separate is ludicrous.  It seems like the price you pay for the software is just the start of a bait and switch scheme.
I actually have recommended TurboTax for years to co-workers and friends.  No longer.  I'm taking my business elsewhere.  I'm making a complaint to the BBB.

Although many years ago I was a raving fan of Intuit, since 2004 I found like each new release of Turbotax and Quicken less and less.  It's obvious they have prioritized revenue generation over customer satisfaction and only respond to customer revolts.  I just switched to TaxCut for the first time and am quite delighted.  
Also, here's tip for those of you forced to do the Quicken upgrade you don't need or want.  Instead of buying the latest version from Intuit, just go online and find one of the earlier "obsolete" versions.  You can usually find them for $10 or less plus shipping and avoid paying Intuit.

From the previews we were hoping for something upbeat and maybe even Chi's jumping and singing as warriors or something... It had almost nothing in common with the theatrical trailer.
I didn't watch it with kids, just my Wife and myself (who both love Disney movies!). We had to turn it off about 3/4 through. We just couldn't take it any more. It does not feel like a theatrical Disney flick, and is even subpar to many of Disneys straight to DVD films.
Buyer beware, I'd strongly suggest renting this one first.

This review is from: The Dark Knight (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)
      
I agree wholeheartedly with Richard O's review, modern "Bread and Circuses" for a morally bankrupt society. Trifling entertainment for 30 year old children who are too brainwashed and fascinated with digital junk to look around and see that Rome is burning. A great cast of actors who obviously needed a quick buck. Christian Bale should go back to making real movies like "Rescue Dawn" and "Empire of the Sun" movies that mean something, movies that portray ordinary people in extraordinary situations. In other words REAL entertainment that does not involve digital explosions and shootout after shootout. I can't believe this movie rose to the rank of number 2 grossing movie of all time! It saddens me to think of a nation and a world that eats this garbage up, beating out movies like "Star Wars" and "Lord of the Rings" which portray real heroes. Batman got old 15 years ago, at least "Superman" was super, all batman has is money, but hey, we are a nation that worships money.

Ordered this MP3 player to replace my 512MB Creative Nuvo. The SanDisk does all the basics just fine. Easy to use. I never even opened the instruction book. Comes with a USB cord, cheap earhpones, an armband, and a very flimsy case that only works with the armband. I recommend the silicone case (+ $8.50). I do like the large, easy to use buttons. I'm able to use them while running, with gloves on, BUT....
One complaint of the player: It is WAY to big and bulky and cheap feeling. It is like a Playskool or Fisher Price MP3 player. Look at the picture of it. See how it looks nice and uniformly flat? It isn't. The back is a huge semi-circular form that adds another inch to inch and a half to the thickness. SanDisk only shows this edited photo for obvious reasons...they are definitely attempting to obscure the true bulk of this player, which is substandard compared to similar products on the market. It will not easily fit into a pocket or slim space, which is a major disappointment for me.

This is a bad movie based on an excellent comic book.  It's a great example of the problems that arise when you try to translate one medium into another.  Still, it has its charms, and it means well.  I gave it two stars, because the film is a fun way to kill ninety minutes, especially if you have some friends over and give it the Mystery Science Theater treatment.  I recommend following it up with some Challenge of the Super Friends DVDs for a night of complete grade Z kitsch.  Take it from this "hairless ape", you could do a lot worse!

**SPOILERS** I was really excited for Breaking Dawn to come out.  I mean REALLY EXCITED.  So like a good Twihard I got my book right at 12:01 and stayed up all night to read it straight through.  
The beginning was pretty good and seemed to flow with the style of the other twilight books.  I liked the wedding, but after that things started to get weird.  The honeymoon wasn't terrible, until Bella got preggers.  I was like WTF?! but I went with it, trusting steph to explain this so it made some sense.  Well, I'm still waiting for that explantation.  
Then all of a sudden it switched to Jacob's POV.  I really didn't want to switch at first, but I quickly warmed to Jake's POV.  I liked learning more about Leah.  That, however, like so many things in this book turned out to be a dead end and complete waste of my time.  Because guess what? As soon as that demon child is born...Jacob imprints on her.  So the one character left who I could relate to goes over to the dark side and becomes unrecoginzable just like everyone else.  
My other WTF?! moment was when Bella told everyone what she was going to name said demon.  Renesmee Carlie.  Please tell me that that name is some kind of sick horrible joke gone wrong.  It was just so tacky to combine everyones name like that.  I actually thought the Cullens had some style and dignity.  My bad.  
Next thing we know Bella was a vampire.  This part of the book was okay.  Until I find out that Bella is basically perfect.  How am I supposed to relate to that?  
Then we are introduced about 800 new characters near the end of the book.  It all builds up to what is supposed to be an awesome climax to the story.  Which ends up dragging on forever and nothing actually happens.  Great, everyone is perfect and none of them even die to even things out (although I am not sure I would've cared by this point because I'd kinda started disliking/hating everyone by then).  The End.  
Wow.  It took awhile for it to sink in how much I really hated the book because I just felt a little numb for about the next 24 hours.  Then it slowly sank it and I started fighting the urge to burn the book. Instead I started writing really long rants (sorry btw) on the internet. The horrid and boring plot totally took over the characters.  They were constantly OOC.
This book doesn't even seem like it was written by SM.  So I have a few theories about that.  Theory #1 She was smoking somethin really strong the whole time she was writing.  Plus she got the stuff from her editor who also seems to have been delusional during the production of this book.  Theory #2 The Host is not actually a fictional book at all, but rather a true story.  Stephanie was taken over by an alien who had no idea how to write, but felt compelled to still finish the series.  Theory #3 Stephanie felt rushed/pressured to finish the book.  She couldn't think of anything so she just copy and pasted a bunch of crappy fanfics to make up breaking dawn.
Also for all of you out there who were throughly disappointed by BD we have a facebook group.  It's called "Is it just me, or did Breaking Dawn suck like a newbornd vampire on a human?"  ALL BREAKING DAWN HATERS, WE MUST UNITE!!! so join the group already, sheesh.
Sorry agian about the length.

I bought this product with great hope and anticipation. I read the rave reviews, and I believed. Boy was I disappointed.
    Prior to purchasing the Bodygroom, I shaved with standard WAHL professional clippers, followed by a straight edge razor. Yes, a straight edge razor, by far the best shave you can get, but you have to be extremely careful, and thus it is very, very time consuming. BUT, the results are outstanding. (On a side note, have your wife/girlfriend do it. It can actually be fun and erotic.)
   The concept of the Bodygroom sounds great, but the actual results do not even come close to the expectations. The small clipper blades would simply get clogged and would not cut the hair. I needed to run the shaver over an area multiple times before I say any results, and those results pale in comparison to the method mentioned above.
   In fact the results are just plain bad. How bad? Norelco does have a 60 day money back guarantee, and I plan to return it immediately.
   As far all the raving reviews... I'm beginning to wonder if they are being paid by Norelco to post them.

I was happy with it for less than two months, and then the keyboard failed. When I press a key, several characters come out. I was on hold for customer support for more than 20 minutes once, and more than 30 minutes a second time without getting to anyone on the other end. Online tech support is a joke, as the tech support staff kept cut-and-paste the same text telling me to call that number. I had been using Dell for the last 10 years, and thought this small, inexpensive PC would be good to browse Internet in the living room. Big mistake! 
I will be more than willing to just forget about the warranty and pay for a replacement myself if there is a place to purchase one. But, I am not able to find one yet. My Eee PC 900 is now collecting dust. I don't think ASUS is ready for prime time...

I was really impressed with this unit when i first got it. I tracked my steps for about 9 months or so before the battery died. I changed out the battery thinking that i could go back to tracking with no problems. Unfortunately I was wrong. Once the battery was changed it couldn't store the time and ran slower then it should have. It now sits on the shelf in my bedroom, not tracking anything but dust growing on it. I gave it 2 stars because it was a great pedometer while it worked.

The reason I'm giving this product 1 star is because it came to me broken. And not only that, but I exchanged it for another that had the exact same problem! I talked to LaCie and they've been receiving a lot of complaints. A bad batch went out, so you have the option of sending it to LaCie for a repair.
 However, the guy at LaCie really sold me on the 1TB Quadra model. He said the Big Disk Extreme is a little faster, but the Quadra is half the size and one drive--making it easier to recover information. The Big Disk Extreme is two hard drives, pretty big, and if some thing breaks, you may be kind of screwed. 
I was able to talk them into shipping me a Quadra instead of repairing my broken Extreme. If I were you, I would just go with the Quadra (unless you need the extra speed). I'm completely satisfied with its performance.

It was a fantastic movie for Batman, the Joker and the D.A., and Batman's ill-fated fan-girlfriend. However, either the theater employees turned up the volume on the music, or the music track played way too loud so that the dialogue could not be heard. What was said at the end of the movie was lost in the loud music. The loud music ruined hearing the last words. I hope that the last dialogue of the DVD is not spoiled like it was in the theater. (Repetition for emphasis) I may rent The Dark Knight first, before I buy it, to make sure that the dialogue is not overpowered by the music score.

My partner and I juice oranges and small red gratefruit daily for breakfast, and this juicer works great for about 2-3 weeks, until which time the motor either burns up or the plastic gears strip out. We've had 6 of these, and the last one just stripped out this morning. Black and Decker outlet stores are very nice about replacing them, but I'm tired of it, so I came on line to search for better products today, which is what prompted this review. Too bad, because if it was constructed a little better, it would be a great compact juicer. Cheers, Gary

Yesterday 1/31 Taxcut was $33 to download.
Today 2/1 it is $41 same as the box set at local stores.
Between Taxcut and TurboTax I'm so confused about what is included (state/no state, number of free downloads 1/5, cost to print additional filings) and now COST $$$$. 
I suggest we all boycott both TurboTax and Taxcut this year for making such a mess of things. 
While I'm on my soapbox,  why does the federal govt even charge us to make it easy for them by e-filing. Second why isn't tax software FREE from Uncle Sammy. Oh I forgot it is to the so called poor. 
Hell with all this, I think I'll go back to handwriting on govt supplied tax forms. Assuming they aren't charging for them at the post office to pay for all the bailouts.
If they didn't owe me this year I think I would just skip filing all together.

I read the manufacturers product description and it sounded just like what I was looking for. "It works with virtually any device with a USB port - even cross-platform from Macintosh to PC and vice versa." When I received the drive, however, it wouldn't work with Mac OS 9.  I am running OS 10 but a lot of the files I wanted to back up were created with OS 9. There was no information on the  web site about supported versions. My OS 9 files were not recognised. I was understandable upset. I contacted Kingston for support and was give a tech solution that was not guarented to work and a disclamer:
"If these steps do not work for you then unfortunately there is nothing else we can do for you."
So much for their "five-year warranty and Kingston's legendary service and support."
The steps didn't work and I am not able to back up the files I need so I guess I am out of luck and Kingston is out a future customer. Lose. Lose.

I've been a Quicken user now for just about ten years and use it to simply track my checkbook and investments.  It does what it's supposed to, however...
The graphics rendering capability is absolutely pathetic.  Some of the investments I track have to be entered manually so I &lt;ALT&gt;&lt;TAB&gt; between Quicken and the website that contains my prices.  Switching back to Quicken takes about 10-20 seconds for the window to redraw properly.  With a half-dozen different investments with high/low/current pricing to manually enter, this takes a long time!  Opening the calendar will take about a minute for it to quit redrawing everything.  My computer is no slouch on the graphics side.  If it can handle 1920x1200x24 World of Warcraft gaming, it should handle pie charts pretty easily.  Not when Quicken is doing the drawing!  After _finally_ getting a response from customer service, they said the only solution was to disable ALL of my graphics hardware acceleration.
If I can find another home financial package that will import all my historical data, I'd jump ship in a second.  Save your money and look elsewhere!

I work in the computer section of a mid-sized printing company, and I also do a lot of web work on the side, so I see a lot of different, and at some points odd) ways to store media.I bought my external 250 drive a few months ago, along with 9 disks to go with it... all of which (drive and disks) are sitting on a shelf collecting dust.This drive does not work well personally, or professionally, whether you want to reuse it a million times, or store important back-ups.  The disks are not dependable enough to rely upon to keep long term back-ups, constant use corrupts the disks, and forget about sending them through the mail!  No matter how careful you are in packaging them, chances are you'll get a few back with messages saying "I can't open most of the files, they've gone bad".Buy a CD writer, test your CDs before you give them to someone else, and you won't have any problems, mail them... step on them... pour some soda on them... as long as you don't play hockey with them, or melt them, you'll be OK.

My USA-19HS worked ok for a couple of months, then stopped working. It started identifying itself as a a TUSB3410 Boot Device, which Keyspan's website says meant it was defective. I then went into customer service hell. After I posted my info to a tech support forum on their website, they vanished. I poked again a week and a half later, and they came back and told me to mail the device in. I did so. Then they vanished off the face of the earth. No replacement sent to me, no posts to my electronic tech support thread (despite multiple posts by me), and they don't answer their phones (there's a recording saying to visit the website). Eventually, weeks later, after I threatened to go to the BBB, someone posted and said they'd look for my device and get back to me that afternoon. Two days later, nothing again.
The device works fine, but heaven forbid you actually need to get it replaced. At this point, I have neither my dead device nor a refund -- I mailed it in, and it's gone in a black hole.

I finally replaced my old broken waffle iron(Cuisinart Round Classic Waffle) with this one thinking I was getting roughly the same iron.  The quality has fallen off greatly : 
1.  The browning controller literally fell off with my first wipe
2.  The plates don't have enough clearance and the waffles come out with holes.  I use a very think batter, this is a serious design flaw.
3.  The heating element shows thorough on the waffle i.e. there's a cook ring within the waffle - looks really stupid.

However, this AM just after the last waffle was cooking, the iron died.  We have had this waffle iron 6 weeks!!  Bed Bath &amp; Beyond was gracious enough to replace the iron.  What's the deal Cuisinart?  I thought I was buying a good product!  When this one dies, I'll buy one from another manufacturer.

The device has the functionality as other people have covered and is in the product documentation.  However I found its support of the 5GHz band is too flaky to be useful.  Everything on 2.4 is fine.  (Using latest B17 firmware).
On the 5GHz band you are fine if doing light web browsing etc, but about 5-10 seconds after you transfer bulk data the connection dies for about 60 seconds (confirmed using perfmon, wireshark and pings).  For example copying a movie file from a camcorder starts at high speed and then fails.  Doing the same thing on 2.4Ghz doesn't result in any issues, but is half the speed of 5Ghz and makes having a dual band device pointless.

Well, enough has been said about the movie and most of us already know what it is. I just want to add to the rant of all the collectors here that this two-disc edition is a big, big disappointment. Is this all they could come up with for a film which was such a big critical and commercial success? A few lame extras and a digital copy?? Duh. Well, I held back buying this release, hoping that there will be a real special edition sometime soon. I know the publishing house is going to milk the fans dry with this one and I refuse to be a vicitim. In case, you still can't hold on, my advise would be to go for the single disc edition and save some of your hard earned money.

The monitor itself was great for about a week and then it froze up and the watch did nothing.  I called Omron and they said that the battery was low and that it must have been on the shelf at Amazon for quite a while and so it got low because Omron put the battery in at the plant.  So...I had to go to a jeweler (because it is sensitive and waterproof and they said not to trust a discount store clerk) and have a battery put in.  I am disappointed that this is not covered by any warranty.  I am disappointed in Amazon for sending out old equipment.

My cat really dug his kitty fountain but my overall experience with this thing was kind of bad.  Yes it recycles the water a bit and keeps it fresher than say a stagnant water filled bowl but it seemed to collect lots of crud and hair that never makes it through the tiny hole to the filter.  The reserve tank was useless...the water level never went down when the water was circulating so it was a pretty big waste of water.  Also, the thing makes terrible noise when not completely full (but the reserve tank never worked) so you have to dump water in it all the time or else listen to this loud grinding sound.  After, 7 or 8 months the pump conked out completely and so I went and bought a Drinkwell for my boy today.  The Drinkwell is superior in every way and kitty is happier with it.

I've always liked the turbotax product until this year when the price increased due to so-called "free" e-file. Last year, I could not e-file because of some error in IRS records not matching my employer ID number. I had to paper file and received a $30.00 refund for the cost of e-filing. This year, if this error occurs, I won't get a refund because the cost of e-filing is already hidden in the cost of the product. I was tempted to use another product but my previous records are already in my turbotax electronic files. Additionally, there's no mention of free state e-filing. So what are you really getting here?

I have been using TurbTax for many years, and have always been happy with it. I liked, in particular, the ability of importing data from mutual fund sales and W-2s. It has always worked, but this year it stopped working for me. I called my mutual fund company, and they claimed that all was well.
I called TurboTax support, and the assistant was nice and tried to be helpful. But in the end, nothing worked. So, I had to input the data manually. Not very satisfactory.
Asides from this, TurboTax is a nice product. The interface seems to ahve improved this year for those that already know what forms they want to fill out. You may miss some helpful advice, but it sure saves time.

I ordered this product and it showed up OK but when I opened the box it was actually a 3 month supply. Amazon wanted me to return the pack of three to them and then they would send me a package of 6.  I suggested that they should send me a package of 3 to make up the difference and the customer service person indicated that this simply could not be done and that I would have to return the 3 pack *at my own expense* and then they would send me a 6 pack.  I asked if I could just get a partial refund. Again, this was unacceptable.  So I had to return to them the 6 pack at my own expense. And I did that.
THEN... here's the kicker...
When the 3 pack that should have been a 6 pack got back to them, they  informed me that I would have to take a full refund of the original purchase because they were OUT OF STOCK on Frontline in the weight class I needed. 
So I had to wait for it to be credited back to my card.  I'm still out of shipping BOTH WAYS and no frontline in hand.
Moral of this story?

Let me start by saying I have two Eclipse I keyboards *office and home) and have put them through their paces.  They keys feel as solid and tight as they did the dirst day.  The lighting has held up well.
I was super excited about the II coming out.  Better media keys, color choices, a dimmer knob...
Only thing is if you want a keyboard you don't have to type on the Eclipse II is the one to get.  The keys are mushy and cheap feeling.  The glossy black platic is a finger print magnate (which given fingers are all over it...).  The media keys are cheaper feeling.  The dimmer knob on mine was loose and felt very cheap.  The backlighting itself... the red and purple were acceptable, but the blue was too dark and too dim to be of use.  Given my rig has blue lighting, this was a sticking point.  
I would look at the first Eclispse or the Logitch well before goign witht he Eclipse II.  It is not worth it for looks or performace.

I purchase Ooma about 1 month ago. Setup was very easy and sound quality was near landline. But problem start when i needed to talk to customer support about deleting and adding a line since i could not do it in OOMA LOUNGE. I start contacting then by phone and e-mail since 3 weeks ago. To this day after several e-mails and phone calls nobody contacted me. That why i decided to return the unit to the retailer. If you are spending a lots of money on nationwide calls and you are not planing to do any kind of maintaineance that require customer service, then you might benefit from this product. But be carefull, since ooma actually is not a UNLIMITED CALLING SERVICE. If you have children that talk all day and total talk is more that 3000 minutes, OOma has the right to disconnect your service or charge you a lots of money without advance notice.(3000 minutes limit) and if you have DSL through your phone company then if you disconnect your service, you won't have broadband. Of course you can get broadband at the higher price without phone service. For us it didnot work since we use our cell phone to call nationwide. Also if Ooma goes out of business (and they are in financial trouble) then your service will be dicconected. (that is why their price is coming down too).
Just do the math.

These diapers WERE great. We had our new born last May, and have used LUVS since birth after trying Pampers and Huggies. On our little one, Huggies leaked all over the place every time, Pampers were OK but not better at a more expensive price. We've been ordering LUVS from Amazon from size 1. Somewhere in the middle of size 3 boxes (a couple of months back), the LUVS diapers that we've received suddenly changed in quality. The cross-hatch is gone (it's all white now), the diapers are thinner, and the elastic on the sides are awful now, they lose their elasticity very easily, and of course that means leaky diapers. We thought that might have been a one-time thing, but the next size 4 box that we ordered are the same 'new' no-good quality. Up above in the images, I see that someone else had the same experience. You can see from the pictures there that the diapers are different now.

I've had the Capresso 560 for nearly three years and, though it has served me well enough, it has never failed to give plenty of bad with the good. Yes, it can produce espresso-level grind. Yes, it produces a good, consistent grind that makes great coffee. So? What's the problem: 
1) When I first got it, the burrs were miscalibrated and it would not grind finely enough. I call to customer service eventually fixed this. 
2) From the first couple weeks, the bean and grind bins developed hairline fractures. Though they've never completely broken, they are now almost opaque from this complex spiderwebbing. 
3) The indicator line on the bean bin rubbed off after only a couple of months. I etched it back on myself, but it was never easy to read. Compare to the Baratza Maetro (my new grinder) on which the line is molded into the plastic. 
4) About 2 years in, the grind indicator lines around the bean bin also began to wear off. As of its recent retirement, the body of the grinder is almost totally devoid of writing. None more black. 
5) Hate the timer knob. Prefer a on/off switch. The timer was never long enough to grind enough beans for a full pot of coffee (12+ cups) and encouraged using the bean bin as an on off switch (in fact, the manual may have instructed using it this way). I feel certain that the constant turning of the bean bin led to the premature failure of the safety mechanism (see below). 
6) Recently (and without warning) the safety (the mechanism that keeps the grinder from running with the bean bin removed. Started making only sporadic contact, meaning the grinder couldn't get up to speed or even work at all. Call to customer service claimed they'd never heard of such a thing and fixing/replacing would be $60. Perhaps that a reasonable amount of time for such a failure, but the cost of repair and lack of access to the mechanism means the grinder is essentially trash. I may try to crack it open a fix it to use as a backup grinder, but it made more sense to just replace it with the superior Baratza Maestro. 
Bottom line: If you have one, you're probably satisfied. If you don't, the Maestro looks like a better grinder for the same (nearly same) money. It has more grind settings, more durable clear plastic parts, produces less static, is quieter, and has an on/off switch. Maybe I'll be replacing it in three years too, but it seems a far more durable product.

It's a shame that this product has to get only one star (it would have gotten zero if that rating was available). The unit is the right size and weight, has a sexy look and feel and is just the right thing to put in your pocket and bring it along on your next trip.  If it only worked!
I connected it, worked with it for an hour or so, loaded data in it and took it along for a long trip.  After using it for half an hour on my laptop the Passport stoped working; it would not connect to the computer. Thumb drives and other external devices worked all right but the Passport refused to idemtify itself to the computer, essentially preventing me from using the data I had stoted in it.  I tried the hardware wizard and all kinds of tweaking but could not get it going. I can feel some vibration, so the unit is working inside, but it won't connect.
My data is locked in the useless Passport, I wasted a lot of time trying to make it workm and I lost my money because I won't return it with my sensitive data in it.  With this kind of unreliability the Pasport is a dangerous place to trust your data!

This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)
      
oh man.  this book has 563 pages.  about 400 of those pages i mostly liked.  the remaining pages were so bad that this only gets two stars. 
this will have spoilers.
like i said in my review of 'twilight' i don't feel the edward/bella relationship.  it's completely ridiculous and unbelievable.  and in the beginning of the book when edward breaks up with her and leaves, i felt nothing, and i was probably supposed to feel as heartbroken as bella.  i felt no emotion because their relationship is a joke.  edward is so boring and dull and completely void of any personality.  and then at the end, when bella has to go "save" him, it's ONLY because he thinks that bella has died and he is going to go commit suicide.  omg.
i had to literally force myself to read the end of this book because all i could think about was that they were only in the situation because edward was so weak and pathetic and selfish that he could not live without bella.  romeo and juliet is a classic work of literature that people should analyze and critique, not live by.  and i found it completely irritating that the author kept bringing it up.  
jacob black was the only thing i liked about this book, and as it turned out, he didn't even need to be in it.  the majority of the book is about bella and jacob's friendship and how jacob is a werewolf.  but he had no part in the climax or conclusion of the book.  (except for the epilogue, which was good) what was the point of having him in there if his storyline wasn't going to tie into the main conflict?  major writing flaw there.  similar to twilight, new moon doesn't have any real plot until the last 100 pages.
jacob is super interesting and has more character development in this book than edward and bella combined in the first two books.  also, the relationship between jacob and bella is way more believable than bella and edward.  when jacob is going through his werewolf changes, he essentially ends his friendship with bella because he believes himself to be a danger.  that scene was so emotional and i felt so much that i actually teared up.  same with the epilogue, it was very emotional.  
i am going to finish the saga because there are characters that i do care about and want to see how their story ends.  however, between bella's over the top emoness over edward, and the horribly contrived "plot" this book was an overall let down.

I've been looking for a new blood pressure monitor. I had been using Mark of Fitness MF-81 Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor for the last year, and while it gave me very steady results, they were always lower than my actual blood pressure reading.  
After looking over the reviews, I selected this Omron monitor with the software.  It never worked for me.  The cuff is very comfortable, but I received more error readings than actual readings. When I received readings they were usually about 10 to 20 points lower than my actual pressure. The readings also varied greatly each time I took them.  
I really wish this unit would have worked. I gave it two stars because I loved the cuff and the idea of the software. I never used the software since I was forced to return the whole thing when I couldn't get an accurate blood pressure reading.

However, it has now stopped pumping water into the filter rendering it useless.  Attempts to contact Cuisinart about replacement or repair (since it has a 3-year warranty) have been unsuccessful.  I've owned many coffeemakers over the years and none have broken as quickly as this one.

i have three computers and this drive has had problems on all of them. if i leave it connected and restart, the drive does not show up on my computer. it seems to only be recognized when i plug it in one out of every 3-4 times. nothing but problems from day one with this drive. also does not shut itself off when not in use like western digital's mybook or the buffalo drivestation. i have several external drives and have never had this much problems till i got this hard drive. i would rate it with a zero but there is no option on amazon for that.

Here's my comprehensive review. Enjoy!
SIZE: The Corsair 64gb flash drive is quite large... it's as long as my WD passport external hard drive and as fat as my thumb. It is difficult to plug in another USB device whilst this guy is attached as it takes up considerable room. It does come with an extension cable which does alleviate this problem, but it's yet another thing you have to carry around. The point of owning a flash drive is portability isn't it? When there are a lot of peripherals to carry around, it defeats this purpose. The cap is also a problem because it becomes loose with time and it's easy to lose.
CASING: The drive is truly water resistant (as long as you still have your cap). It has a rubber shell that's pleasant to touch and it bounces when dropped. The more important aspect of this rubber texture is the fact that it grabs a hold of the inside of your pocket. Unlike some of the other reviews I've read, I actually like it .It's more difficult to accidently lose the drive when removing other objects from your pocket, like change.
DESIGN: It's fairly ugly and it looks like an adult toy due to its size. Sorry, Corsair, but it does!
FILE SYSTEM: It is formatted as FAT32. You cannot copy files larger than 4 gigabytes in size onto the drive because of this. I formatted mine to NTFS, which turned out to be a big mistake! DO NOT format it as NTFS!!! You will lose considerable read/write speeds if you do, even with a larger cluster size, say 16k. NTFS also burns out flash drives much quicker than FAT32 because NTFS writes to the drive even if files are only read. Also, once you change it to NTFS you'll have a hard time getting it back to FAT32 if you're on Windows: you'll need 3rd party software to do it, like Acronis Disk Director Suite.
SPEED: TESTED ON WINDOWS VISTA ULTIMATE. I feel very disappointed with the speed of the drive. Read speeds were alright, but the write speeds are unacceptable. With the FAT32 file system write speeds average 1-1.3 MBps. Ehh. With NTFS write speeds deteriorated to 300 KBps! Now that is slllooooowwww. Keep it as FAT32 like I recommended before.
CONCLUSION: The drive is too big physically to be a flash drive and too slow to be comparable to an external hard drive. If you want portable storage with this kind of capacity, get an external hard drive instead. The technology just isn't there right now to really be useful. I recommend a WD passport as a substitute.

I'm sorry, but this unit makes very weak coffee.  I really wanted to like this thing, because of the great variety of coffee choices available, but many of them are just barely drinkable.  I have to go along with a reviewer on another site who said that it's OK the Keurig doesn't make a full mug, because you wouldn't want to drink a full mug of this stuff anyway.
This unit really, really needs some way to control the brew strength.
On the plus side, there are a few "extra bold" varieties, but just a few, so if you stick to those, you miss the major advantage of the Keurig.
My wife and I also noticed that all of the coffe made with the Keurig had a flavor element in common.  It's not quite a vending-machine flavor, but it's something that's not present in coffee made other ways.  
As I write this, I'm sitting here drinking a cup of brown dishwater, a.k.a. French Vanilla, and planning on returning the unit.  Looks like it's back to Taster's Choice Hazelnut instant for me.  Not a great coffee, but the flavor beats any of the K-cups and I can make it as strong as I like.

I got this for my Husband for Christmas.  Due to circumstances, we had to open presents early (Wednesday, 23rd).  He was so excited!  We hooked it up to the computer to set it up.  All that appeared on the screen was vertical colored lines.  This went on for 10 minutes, then the screen went blank.  We could not start it back up, left it plugged in for a while thinking that the battery needed charging.  Come back later, NOTHING!  Contacted Apple, they say that it has to be shipped back for repair/parts/service/replacement.  Merry Christmas honey!  He got to look at it for 15 minutes!  Now I guess it will take approximately 8 to 12 weeks for them to send it back to us.  THANKS APPLE!

This has turned a relatively stable suite of products into a less-intuitive and less-productive hassle. Word and Excel crash regularly, documents that are related to Office download from Safari as .xla, .pot and .dot. For me, though, the biggest issue is the revisions to the Excel chart maker and it's lack of an x-axis naming field. All in all, Office 2008 adds about 25% more time to projects than it's predecessor.

We just bought one of these things.  Actually got one with two bowls.  Both bowls went into the deep freeze.  After 7 hours we tried using the first bowl.  It was frozen solid.  We made the simple vanilla recipe in the book.  All we got was vanilla flavored cold soup after 30 minutes.  We put the liquid into the freezer in an ice cream container.  Ended up with a rather large vanilla ice cube.  The second bowl stayed in over 24 hours and we tried the vanilla recipe again.  Same results after 30 minutes.What a waste of money.  It's going back and I'm getting down my old Rival ice and salt style ice cream maker.

If you are considering getting this trimmer, all you need to know is this: The 9 lockable length settings don't actually lock!! I tried putting it on length "3", but when I started to trim, it went down to length "2".  Then I started on length 2 and it went down to length 1.  Besides this, the cutting block is too far away from the thing that touches your face (not sure what it's called), so it's very hard to cut any hair at all unless you choose the length setting 3 or lower.  I know all this may come as a surprise to those of you who have had success with previous Norelco trimmers, but the fact is that this thing is a serious piece of Sh_t.  In my estimation, their aspirations to achieve the fancy "vacuum effect" has clouded what should be their primary goal with this device: to trim facial hair EVENLY and EFFECTIVELY!  I would have given this 0 stars if it would have been an option.

I set the wireless router up according to the instructions in order to add a notebook computer to my AOL account.  Worked like a champ for about 48 hours.  Then, certain web sites would no longer load on my desktop that is connected to the router via ethernet cable (particularly web sites that require a log in).  After another 48 hours or so, I could not access the web at all.  I had to reboot the router and reload the software, and the whole process repeated itself.  I have no idea what the problem is.

I was excited to get this iced tea maker--we really drink a lot of iced tea.  I received it as a gift about a week ago, and today, I got it out to use it for the first time.  I filled it with water and ice, placed my tea bags in the basket, put it all together and plugged it in.  I pressed the "on" button, it lit up, and then I sat down with a magazine.  I could hear it starting to brew, but after about a minute, it just stopped.  I checked, and the light was off.  I tried to turn it back on, but nothing happened when I pressed the button.  I tried moving to a different outlet, plugging it in, and turning it on, and again, nothing.  It won't brew tea and the light doesn't even turn on.  I'm very upset about the poor quality of this item, especially since I wanted this particular tea maker instead of the Mr. Coffee one in part because of the reviews I read here.  I've called Hamilton Beach but have been unable to find someone who can help.  Guess I'm just stuck with it.

I tried OneCare's trial version on a new computer we put into our small business network.  I had intermittent problems loading and printing across the network through some of our older DOS programs (yes, we still use several old programs because they work great). The puzzling thing was that I could reboot the computer one time, or nine times before the DOS programs would load and print--it was that unpredictable. I disabled OneCare to see if it was causing the problem.  The problems persisted, so I assumed it was caused by something else and bought OneCare through Amazon for all our computers.  The same problems then occurred with those computers, so I uninstalled OneCare, which solved all our loading and printing problems.  I also found that OneCare slows Netscape to a crawl (yeah, I know--it's a dinosaur, but so am I).  Microsoft may treat you OK if you use all the latest apps, but apparently they don't even test this product on older software.  I switched to Avast, and life is good.

I question all these excellent reviews I see for this product. I wonder if they are plants from the company or seller. This product is annoying at the very least. The speaker is small and the sound is not very good. In addition, every sound has a distinct background sound that loops every 4-5 seconds. After awhile, it becomes hard to focus on the  intended sound whether its the rain, waterfall, etc.. Save your money and get a cheap cd player with speakers and environmental sound CD. You will sleep or relax better.

He spoke over me refusing to listen to my reasoning then began screaming at me. He demanded I post positive feedback first, and then he would refund my money. Feeling blackmailed I refused.

If you're cat is an indoor cat, yes this product will work well for you. But if your cats go outside like mine, FORGET IT! Yes Advantage kills fleas that are on your pet immediately. But it does not keep them flea free for 30 days, like they advertise. I've tried Advantage on my cats a few times. The fleas that were on my cats did die within 12 hours. But within ONE WEEK they were biting and scratching again like before. I'm picking fleas off of them after only a week and a half. If the product wasn't so expensive, it might be worth the money. But don't waste your money, because it only works well for a few days. Frontline works a lot better.

I will freely admit to loving the first three books, but as for Breaking Dawn, all I can say is WTF????? I eagerly waited at Barnes and Noble to get my copy at MN and rushed home to read it. After the perfect wedding and start of a great honeymoon, my bliss dissolved into numb disappointment and anger. How is Bella pregnant? What kind of name is Reneesmee Carlie? What next Rosalice or her brother Jasemmett?? 
        I just felt the whole time that I read this book that it was a different author writing this [..]. The characters felt different, like it was a new Bella and Edward. Stephenie Meyer wouldn't destroy her characters like this. She wouldn't have Jacob IMPRINT on a BABY!!!!
      The book was saturated with plot that made little sense. Would Alice really leave without saying why? Could we cram another vampire with a screwed up name in the story? So many new characters with no reason to care about them. The climax with the Volturi was anticlimactic which was a letdown. We have been so worried about how the Volturi were going to interfere with Bella and Edward and we got that? No one died, not that I wanted to lose anyone, but that's not realistic. Characters die, as we all know.
    As far as I'm concerned, Eclipse was the end. I will imagine their REAL happily ever after. Well, SM you had a good career until now. I hope it was worth it to destroy your characters.

I recently purchased the Linksys router and have now spent the better part of 2 days attempting to get it to work with my laptop. I do not consider myself to be a real techie but have spent the last 5 years working in IT and usually have no problem. Unfortunately for me, I ran into problems setting up the router with my T1 line and routing it wirelessly to a Centrino IBM laptop. 
My experience with Linksys tech support was one of the worst experiences I have had. The reps were dificult to understand and their knowledge of the technology was severely lacking. In addition, on multiple occasions, the reps would hang up when the troubleshooting reached a dead end. 
Only advice: Hope your installation is flawless. Because if you run into any remotely complex problems, you may end up spending days trying to resolve it.

I got this Zen 8gb player yesterday, and plugged it in to charge it. It charged all day yesterday and all night last night - at least 15 hours, when I unplugged it this morning it showed a full charge, then 10 seconds later the battery indicator dropped 1/4, then to 1/2 then it turned red &amp; said low battery - the battery was fully dead in less than 1 minute.
I called technical support, the lady told me to "update" the firmware so I did the "update" even though the new firmware is the same version as the one I had on my less than 24 hour old mp3 player. It's now been charging for 2.5 hours and I just checked it a minute ago and the battery still dies completely within one minute of trying to use it...
I've been reading online, seems this is a very common problem with this MP3 player. I'm bummed too because this one looks nice and seems like it'd be great but I can't get it to work, and apparently a lot of other people have the same problem.
Now I have to send it back and hope for a refund....

You know, there are plenty of excesses in every human institution:  Schools, health care, government, families, the workplace, and, of course, religion. I'm all for going after con-men (and women), hypocrites,  sheer stupidity, bigotry,  and malfeasance! But Bill, you get a bit boring when you repeat over and over again the atheist mantra that if you can't touch it, hear it, see it, smell it, taste it - it plum does not exist! Gee! Why did I not think of that! Life is like a light switch! And the" joke" is on everyone who doesn't believe that you're so smart or all-knowing! 
I didn't enjoy seeing people who are somewhat troubled being exploited, so you can have a good laugh at their expense. Did it ever cross your mind that there's a really big difference between sincerely held beliefs, no matter how outlandish -  that are not hurting anyone - and those who use religion for profit and/or to control others? 
Bill, you also came across stupid yourself. The Ex-Gay clergyman who believes being Gay is a sin - "looks Gay" because he's "neat and good-looking!"  Give me a break! What you unwittingly succeeded in doing was make this bigot look sympathetic, instead of scary,  because you came across as such a jerk!
 
I'm all for your attacks on the greedy pigs, crazy bigots  and mind-boggling hypocrites you so cleverly expose! Too bad you had to knock-down innocent believers that are not hurting anyone, in the process

I have had two of these players in the space of a week.  Both broke down almost immediately. 
The major flaw in this machine is the USB charging.  You have to register it first, and it has to have power to register.  If your battery runs out, you cant register, so you've got yourself a very stylish brick.
In short, Creative Labs made a very stylish player that has one fundamental flaws.  Get an iRiver, a Zune or an iPod.

Like many on this forum, I am disappointed with the 500gig My Book because it died after 14 months, and the warranty lasts only 12. Turned on the computer one day, heard a hard clicking sound and - poof! it was dead. And to make things even more disconcerting, this is the second WD drive I have had fail on me within a few months. One of the two WD 500 gb drives in the RAID array inside my main PC died as well about a month prior. (Thank God I was smart enough to have purchased a RAID array on my main PC or I would have lost everything.) I have a strong feeling that the WD 500 gig models were not built well. (Don't know about the 1TB models.)
Also, as others have noted, besides the 12 month warranty there is no separate on/off switch which makes it harder to turn off the drive. (The blue botton in the middle did not work reliably for me.) My new drive is an Iomega 1TB model that has this feature. Hopefully, by powering off when I am not backing up, it will extend the life of the drive. 
Because the My Book was intended for use strictly as a backup device, there was no data permanently lost. But I strongly recommend not buying a My Book or any other single drive solution to hold precious photos, quicken files etc. Only use it as a back up device. If you need to add additional storage that will hold precious data, do yourself a big favor and buy a home office NAS device like the one from NetGear or Cisco - and make sure you have 2 drives in the device. (Many come with 1 and you have to buy the second one.) Yes, it will set you back $400 or more dollars but that is nothing compared to the tragedy of losing irreplaceable photos, videos, music etc. As an IT professional, I can tell you that hard drives are the most fragile part of the PC and can die at any time without warning. That is why all important servers in a business environment use RAID (multiple hard disks) to ensure redundancy. Do the same for your home PC.

I was very impressed after reading the raves on amazon and decided to give it a try. So excited to open the box after couple days of waiting, I baked my first loaf the same day I received it.The bread was burned in the buttom but very good texture inside. Of course, the cycle was very long and preheating time alone was about 30-40minutes.  I thought , maybe I need work on the precision of measurement. Then I noticed the cermaic piece holding heating coil was broken into two pieces, the heating element had nowhere to sit but resting on the botton of the unit. Then I took a look at my old Oster bread machine and found out the heating element was fixed securely to the side of the oster machine with cermaic insulator, nothing shaky and unstable like the heating coil in the panasonic unit.  I have a small kid running around and curious about everything, if the heating coil sitting on the button and heat the whole unit, it becomes a fire hazard. I had no chice but return it. 
         Disappointment is a understatement after reading so many great reviews on amazon and epinion. But the design of the cermaic piece is very unreliable and could turn this machine into a disaster. 
        I did some research on the web and found out the ceramic piece has been a common complaint. if you turn the pages of review on amazon, you will see several reviews mentioning the same problem. But the most recent reviews did not note anything like it. Just want to let people know, the problem is still there, and please take into consideration.

No matter how cold I got the liquid and how much I made sure the frozen bowl was at zero degrees (the way other users have advised), I got a ring of immoveable solid frozen liquid all the way around the edge of the bowl, and cold liquid in the middle - and the machine wouldn't do any more than that.

If you need the calendar function, give that up right now because if you have a large calendar, the iPod Classic will NOT work for you. (note: the 5th generation video handles large calendars beautifully.)
Everything you try to do on the Classic happens extremely slowly, and it only shows a subset of your contacts if you have many. (the 5th generation video is much faster and can show all of your contacts.)
The screen scratches the second you take it out of the box. That's right: Build quality is down too. (i've been carrying around my 5g video with no case for over a year and it's barely scuffed.)
Also, the new version of Solitaire is slow and ugly as hell. How did they find a way to make a slow version of SOLITAIRE? In 2008?? (every previous ipod with solitaire plays it very quickly.)
This iPod was a huge step DOWN from the 5th generation video. I'm going to get a hard drive upgrade in my 5th generation (30-&gt;80) and stay with a true classic until Apple makes an ~80 gigabyte Touch, since clearly they don't give a ---- about their scroll wheel players anymore.

Moonlight is a collection of everything bad about the vampire film genre. With poorly written uncharismatic characters, like Mick: the man unwillingly turned by his vampire wife, and the suddle-as-a-sunrise romance between the male and female leads. The episode plots are laughable, ranging from a recently turned doctor vampire to a rampaging teen vampire with hormonal issues. There are also half baked love triangles and poor attempts at "shadow conspirecies" that make you wonder if the writers where being timed on how fast they could churn out a story as opposed to actually writting something worth watching. Sadly the producers tried to bank on a show who's main draw was a goodlooking male lead. This is almost the same gameplan as trying to sell young males on Halle Berry as Catwoman, and look how that turned out. Note to the potential buyer: There are only 16 episodes for a reason!

First of all there is no bridge mode, so if you connect it to another router you will have two subnets going, and any ports you want to open will have to be opened twice, once on each router. So onto the speed of the router. I thought that maybe I was getting low speeds because I was running through two routers, so I got rid of the router that was before the Dir-825, and put a little Ethernet hub there instead. The hub does no routing so it doesn't effect speed. After this my speed still sucked, oh and i'm talking about WIRED. Yea wired I was getting downspeeds around 3 Mbps. Moving onto wireless. The 2.4ghz band is a joke, I was getting throughput under 1Mbps. Under the 5ghz band I reached speeds around 3Mbps, but I could rarely even detect the 5ghz network. Even when I was in the same room as the router, the 5ghz network would not always appear under my choice of available networks, and yes it was set to broadcast. 
My setup prior to this was my Asus router would go into the ethernet hub, and then the ethernet hub would go into an Apple Airport Express. On the 5ghz network on the express I would do 10Mbps downstream. The only reason I got rid of that setup was because when I would do heavy downloading on my wired that was connected to the hub, the airport express would get very little bandwidth from the hub, and I figured an actual wireless router in place of the switch would be able to route the bandwidth more efficiently. Boy was this router a bad choice. Now when I do heavy downloading, I can barely browse the the web over wired. I'm sending this back, and getting a Apple Airport Extreme.
Oh I almost forgot, the install CD is horrible. In order to set up the router after reset, I had to reconnect the computer without the router, really annoying if your connections run throughout the house. Also the CD takes at least 15 minutes to set up the router which in my opinion is way too long.

Bought this router for my home - it works fine with my roommate's Windows PC but just refused to with my Macbook. It didn't come with any detailed instructions, only a one-click installation CD which runs only on Windows. Tried pretty much everything I could find on the internet but failed. "Linksys customer service does not support MAC" - thats the one line response I got when I called them for assistance. Would have returned it but a friend put in a round-about fix to make it work .. but even with that I need to change a list of settings each time I switch between home and school. It is painful but it works!

This was my first year using TurboTax for Business and if you aren't already basically familiar with business tax returns, this program isn't much help.  It won't take a well-intentioned small business owner and transform him/her into someone who can accurately produce corporate income tax returns.
And if you already are familiar with business taxes, why would you need this program?  It offers little guidance and doesn't seem much better than just reading the raw IRS instructions.

I bought this unit based on these reviews, and it slowly stopped working, one hub at a time, until now, not quite 2 years later, it has died.  I'm on an iMac, and did not have any system problems with it, but would prefer to have equipment that will last. We didn't have alot of externals on the unit, but it has been "plugged in" so perhaps you should just expect this unit to only last less than 2 years if you buy it.

I hate it when one little detail can ruin an entire book for me.
**SPOILERS AHEAD**
I still love Twilight and New Moon.  And the first half of Eclipse is good.
And I also must say I have nothing against Jacob.  He annoys me with some stupid, selfish, twisted things he does, but he's still an interesting character.  And in the end, he got what he knew was coming, so I'm good with that.
I'm sorry, but Bella's sudden realization of, "Oh yeah, I love Jacob, too," just doesn't fly with me.
If I read right, it's an interesting concept--I think Meyer was hinting that Bella and Jacob were imprinted, but Edward's existence messed that up, and Bella's tug for him is stronger (maybe they were meant to be imprinted in a past life, but his being a vampire ruined it somehow, I don't know).  And in the end, Bella went with the guy she already knew she couldn't live without, despite Jacob saying Edward was her drug, but he would be her sun and air.
But Meyer really messed it up.  In the first two books, and most of the third, Jacob is a clear-cut, defined family member to her.  No hinting at other feelings whatsoever.  Then when Jacob kisses her and interprets her trying to hurt him wrongly, and deepens the kiss, and Bella suddenly gives in and thinks, "Oh!  I do love him."
Just... no.
Look.  The idea of imprinting (also known as soul mates) is that you're connected to that person whether you like it or not.  And outside circumstances do mess that up.  In L.J. Smith's Daughters of Darkness, for example, Mary-Lynnette and Ash are soul mates.  Throughout the story Ash realizes he loves her, but Mary-Lynnette fights it until the end.  The key different here, though, is that Mary-Lynnette learns more about Ash and comes to appreciate some of his qualities.  That, and there is nothing stronger pulling her away from him.
Also, in the end, Mary-Lynnette is still a little frightened of Ash and what he's done in the past, and she basically tells him to go away so he can try to redeem himself and she can finish at least high school.  Ash tells her he'll come back in a year, and she says, "That may be too soon," and Ash simply says, "I know.  I'll come back anyway."
Basically, L.J. Smith acknowledged that as they were, it couldn't work out--both Ash and Mary-Lynnette had to work out their own lives, first.
Stephenie Meyer, in Eclipse, had me all set and thinking Jacob was like Bella's brother, and then out of nowhere it's, "I love him, too."  Yes, she slightly redeems it with, "I love Edward more," but it was still unexplained, out of nowhere, and created angst where there shouldn't have been.  It was much more interesting when Jacob was stubborn and Bella already knew where her life was going.  Screwing it up like that just felt like she wanted to get some of her own fantasies into the book, belatedly, or that she wanted to appease some fans somewhere, or leave it open.
And it wouldn't have been a bad idea... if her backstory for them in Twilight and New Moon hadn't been so solid.
I will say, however, that Edward's growth of character was a pleasure.  I did enjoy that.
The only problem is, I'm wary of picking up Meyer's new adult book when it comes out next year.  I was all set to, but that major flaw just... I dunno.  It left a sour taste in my mouth, especially since I'd been admiring her foreshadowing and plot twists and originality so much.

To complete the e-File process requires you to print out a paper form 8453-S, sign it and submit it back to the TurboTax program in PDF format for inclusion in the electronic return.
TurboTax suggests three ways to produce this PDF file:
1. Fax it or submit it via Internet to a third party service for conversion - which means you would be giving out sensitive private financial information - I can't believe they would even suggest this.
2. Create the PDF file yourself by scanning it and converting it using a commercial product such as Adobe Acrobat (expensive) or by using TurboTax PDF Printer Driver. There is a link to the Intuit site to download this driver but the link is broken. The driver does not appear to be anywhere on the Intuit site. E-mail to Intuit support was answered by someone who, judging from the answer, was not even aware of the existence of TurboTax Business.
3. Go to an office supply store to have the file converted (for a fee of course).
I wasted half a day on this. Mailing the paper return seems now attractive in comparison.

We have bought Advantage through Amazon many times, and it has always worked great.  But this last batch has been completely ineffective.  Might as well put water on my dogs.  My dogs are small, little silky terriers, and one is horribly allergic to fleas, so we are having a terrible time. The fleas are very healthy!!

This is our second HoMedics sound machine. Our first one basically stopped working after about 9 months. As some of the other reviewers mentioned, it "shorts out" when you turn the knob  and sometimes it wouldn't come on at all. Figuring it was just a bad one, we decided to give it another shot and bought it again. BIG MISTAKE! This one developed the same problem after only about 3 weeks. We've learned our lesson and will not be using a HoMedics product again. Hope they fix this design flaw! Be wary of purchasing this product!

Professional users beware - there is not much to like with this version of the Office Suite.  I had to purchase the full version as my disk crashed and I could not find my prior software disks (Office 2003).  I have been laboring along for 2 months trying to work out problems with Office 2007, but I think I will buy Office 2003 on ebay and try to take Office 2007 off.  My main gripes - Outlook doesn't work - it insists I am on a LAN and won't load my personal folder from before (that is the main reason for buying over home edition).  Tech support was a gal in China, I gave up with her efforts to solve. Other gripes - All functions create files in a new format that is not compatable with earlier versions of PowerPoint, etc.  You have to remember to save in the earlier format if you share files with other folks lucky enough to have earlier versions.  Office 2007 has somehow disabled my DVD/CD writer so I can't use that.  The new toolbar 'ribbons' are frustrating for someone who has used earlier Office versions for years.  They are not intuitive and you spend too long trying to find what you need.  I still cannot copy live links into another document as plain text, cannot format documents as I want, and hate the defaults.  The spell checker defaults to French, the Word documents to some crazy font I've never heard of, and double spacing.  Powerpoint is slightly more powerful if you figure out how to use it.  Excel is about the same - the least change it seems.  Microsoft and their outsourced help group get an "F" from me.  I was asked to list all the problems I found.  I said I get $200 an hour for technical support and I haven't heard back!   Microsoft - stop trying to be an Apple and keep your products consistent.

This product worked great for the first three weeks... then it wouldn't save anything.

NO CHILD SAFETY MECHANISM:  If you have a young child in the house, PLEASE DO NOT put a Keurig machine in your home.  I own three different Keurig machines. I enjoy them so much that I gave my daughter and son-in-law a Keurig B60 for Christmas 2008.
About a month after Christmas their two and a half year old had watched them enough times that when no one was in the kitchen he took a chair climbed up, lifted the Keurig handle up and down then started pressing buttons.  Well it was only a matter of seconds before scalding hot water was pouring out and splattering on our toddler.  I knew I had read somewhere there was a cup sensor that wouldn't allow water to come out if a cup was not present.  After calling Keurig and telling them what had happened they informed me that the "Individual Model" was the only one with that feature.  THINK ABOUT THAT -it is the only one that doesn't have a water reservoir so this incident can't happen on that model but it has the safety feature.  I told Keurig this is a huge liability and I have seriously doubt this would be an isolated case.  PLEASE if you have young children don't put this machine in your home, the consequences are not worth it.

I received my Zen-via-a-meditative-white-rectangle eight hours ago and it's been a complete and thorough disappointment.

Creative does offer an apology and directions on where to go, so I can't claim they're completely worthless.  Stick with the iPods - you pay more for the quality (i.e., they turn on and play music like you would expect), but you're not wasting time boxing up and shipping back garbage.

I have used Dragon NaturallySpeaking more than seven years, starting back with version 5. Each new version has been better, and version 9 was clearly a substantial improvement. It was fast, accurate, and reasonably stable. I use it every day for e-mail, notes, and letters. 
When I saw the advertisement for version 10, I trusted the ad line that it was even faster and more accurate. Besides, shouldn't my new Dell desktop with dual core Pentium processors (running Windows XP) be able to handle version 10.
Wrong I was. After installing the software last week, I have experienced software lock-up every 15 or 20 minutes. Closing Dragon and restarting the software is not enough. I have to reboot my Dell to clear out memory in order to get another 15 or 20 minutes of reasonable function, until the software locks-up again.
In addition, I frequently experience long (up to 15 second) delays between pronunciation of a sentence and appearance of the words on the computer screen. I will confirm that word recognition accuracy is good, even better than Dragon version 9 (which wasn't bad).  
My opinion: if you are running version 9, stay with it. Version 10 is unstable and interfaces poorly with other programs such as MS Word and MS Outlook.  Version 10 still needs a lot of work before it is ready for prime time.

I have 2 Australian Shepherds, and just with a little bit of pressure their nails would stop the motor.  I am well accustomed to grooming and nail trims as a dog breeder and former vet tech.  It isn't my technique.  Dremmel tools are much more powerful.  That's what you should be using on medium and large sized breeds.  I did call customer service about their product just to see if there could be something wrong with the product.  I received mine as a gift, so I have no idea where my friend bought this product.  Customer service wouldn't even talk to me without an account with them.  When I asked to speak with a manager, she said I would have to call back in 30-45 minutes because all managers were on the phone.  I already had to wait on hold for 15 minutes to talk to her.  Evidentially they have no ability to call people back.  I've completely had it with this company and their product!

This thing is supposed to provide fresh water for your pets, right? Well we stopped using ours and went back to the old water bowl, because dust would build up on the surface of the water.  The water flow was slow, not providing good filteration.  The dish gets scummy fast, and the filters got nasty in just a couple of days.  Before long we found mold in the filer and inside the machine.  It is not easy to clean, and requires constant maintainance.  We stopped using the filer for a while and it worked a little better, but what is the point of that?  I wouldn't reccomend buying one - I'd give you ours if I could.

I can trace the start of my disappointments to about 7-8 years ago.  This was when they started what I now refer to as "Relentless Marketing".
How many Quicken mail and email offers did I get each year?  Dozens.
Phone calls?  Lots.
For a (deluxe) product selling for about $60.
But that wasn't enough.  BESIDES that there was constant blunt instrument pressure: "you should upgrade for only..."
And the marketing icons on your desktop.
Auto-installed trial software and demos.
And more.
This is the state of business today.  Customer service, support, maintenance, innovation, value: pretty much out the window.  The strategy of the day is MARKETING uber alles.  Short term thinking to make money this minute; the heck with tomorrow!
Nowhere was Quicken's change of philosophy more evident than when they started Quicken Loans.  Low monthly payments.  Look how much house YOU can really buy.  You CAN have it all!
How many interest-only loans do you think they made?
Think they're making a lot of loans right now?
Do you think Quicken will be a "mortgage-crisis" casualty?
I'll bet there were a lot of mouths in that trough - how to feed them now?
I speculate that the 2009 release is an effort to generate more cash, fast, before things get worse. Even if it doesn't "save" the business at least the execs will get their bonuses and golden parachutes.
Somewhere I think I still have a set of floppies from 1996 or so.
Used to upgrade about every 2 years.  Some new heights in the some revs, but agree with the consensus: the trend has been diminishing returns.
I will maintain hope but it's sad to watch a formerly great company to continue go down the tubes.

I bought the Flip Mino so that students could borrow it to use in a course that I teach at a university.  I was drawn to the Mino because of the price, ease of use, and recording duration (60 minutes).  I was also impressed with the quality of the video image.  However, when I tried to record a subject only 3 feet away talking in a normal tone of voice, the recorded volume was so low that I will not be able to use it for the purposes I intended.  Even on maximum volume and with the speakers on my PC turned all the way up, I am barely able to hear what the subject is saying on the recording.  I tried playing the recording on a different PC, but the volume was still inadequate.  I then contacted Flip customer support and sent a sample recording and was told that "this video didn't seem extraordinary." I will try to get my money back.

lets get down to brass tacks, this is the by far the slowest flash drive i have. i bench tested it myself, and the results were depressing. the sustained read averages around 19 kbps, random read about the same, sustained write about 6.5, and worst of all, random write is averages 2.7. 
if speed matters to you, do not buy this drive. on the other hand, if you want a cute looking, vista endorsing little drive to throw a few text files on now and then, i suppose this is the drive for you.
on a brighter note, shipping was fast, and product was well packaged.

I just finished BD and I'm left confused and dazed. Did I read everything correctly? B&amp;E having a child and then Jacob imprinting on said child.... that seems beyond comprehension to me. And I found the "sex scenes" to be completely retarded. Even if SM didn't want to go into detail she could have done better than "he led her into the sea and then they woke up the next morning". There was no magic between B&amp;E like in the other three books. I mean in Eclipse we have that astounding bedroom scene between B&amp;E and there is nothing like that in BD. But instead we get gross scenes of Bella giving "birth" and having to drink blood (when she's human). The only thing that redeems this book for me is the last third. Mainly the last few paragraphs, where Bella figures out how to let Edward read her thoughts. In fact, that scene might have been the only scene in the book that I felt even remotely reflected the past three books. Right now I'm very disappointed, but who knows maybe this will grow on me.

Worried I was being unfair I hooked up my old sony camcorder, a DCR-101 (mini DV) from 2002, to the TV and the image was much much better.

This review is from: Wall-E (Two-Disc and BD Live) [Blu-ray] (Blu-ray)
      
My husband and I eagerly looked forward to receiving our pre-ordered copy of Wall-E from Amazon as the trailers had given us high expectations for another excellent and entertaining PIXAR product we could share with our grandchildren. Instead what we received was a computer animated forum for advancing today's political agendas! We wanted entertainment and state of the art animation for ourselves and our grandchildren, not hackneyed political whining and attempts at mind control and thought policing of the very young and impressionable people who will watch this movie.
If those of you considering buying this movie have grown steadily weary of Hollywood and the government attempting to dictate your value system through every possible venue you should definitely avoid this movie. If Disney is compelled to politicize their movies then the movies should be provided to the public at no cost as is the case with other political media.
Also, are we the only ones who recognized the plot to be interestingly close to that of the Movie "Silent Running" starring Bruce Dern? And how about the names of Bruce's little robot buddies, "Huey, Dewy and Louie" and that look a lot like Wall-E?

A few years ago, I was one of the unlucky 'early adopters' of a Linksys 4 port router (wired type) and, for almost a year, had to endure continuous firmware updates before Linksys got that router's problems fixed.  Now, again, I am an 'early adopter' of a Linksys product - the Linksys 54G wireless broadband router - and, deja vue, I am back where I was with problems with this latest piece of Linksys technology.  Two phone calls were made to Linksys tech support during which a firmware update to the 54G router and multiple resets of my cable modem and the 54G and reboots of my computer were required to get the 54G to connect on the WAN/Internet side of the router to the cable modem. I then set up the Linksys wireless-G notebook adapter and was, for a short time, able to access the internet until my laptop froze and I had to reboot.  After rebooting, no recognition of the wireless network.  I eventually got it to connect and found that the 54G router had dropped the WAN connection again and nothing I did would reestablish it - AAAARRRRRGGGGGHHHHHH! I am not willing to, again, be a paying Linksys product beta tester.  Everything is going back to the store for a refund.  By the way, I stopped using my Linksys 4 port wired router (its sitting, unused, in a drawer) and replaced it with an SMC 4 port wired router - the SMC 7004ABR - and have never had a problem with it. When SMC has a similar product to the Linksys 54G, I will try it.  After this latest Linksys dissapointment, I have decided to never buy any of their products again.

This tape is a great idea, but the design is poorly executed.  The little plastic cylinder on the end of the tape freely slides out of the main body.

Okay, it's supposed to be "compact" but it's designed with the 4 USB ports facing in all 4 directions, 90 degrees from each other, so all the items you plug in spread out to take up way too much space!

The fourth and final DVD movie shows, quite clearly, why episodic television rarely translates to feature length with any real appeal.
The first movie was pretty good, the following three are abysmal. 
"Green Yonder" doesn't sink quite to the depths of horribleness as "Billion Backs" does, but it's got few laughs (I chuckled exactly once) and watches like an episode that's four times longer than it needed to be.

Too expensive for what you get as a product.  This shaver doesn't shave that well.  For one thing it is too loud and doesn't shave neck hair.  I bought a norelco shaver and I like that one better but I guess its a personal choice.

1.  Plugged it into a USB port of my Windows Vista PC.
2.  Vista did a blue-screen emergency shutdown and wouldn't boot again.
3.  Techies at the computer shop got it to boot again, advised me to never ever plug that joystick in again.
4.  Spent a couple of hours online looking for an update to make the stick compatible with Vista.  Consensus of the forums on the topic:  Logitech hasn't bothered to develop and release a Vista compatibility update.  
5.  As a final note confirming the incompatibility, the Logitech utility application that comes with the joystick won't even load in Vista.
Microsoft ought to be ashamed of the number of devices and applications they rendered useless with Vista.  Logitech ought to be ashamed for both not working on compatibility, and still marketing this thing that only works with superseded versions of Windows.

I have also had many crashing episodes of both word and ppt. 
Pro's..slightly faster, don't have to deal with a million toolbars. I like the automatic lines that pops up when moving objects in ppt. It also automatically taps into your iphoto to insert pics, which is nice. 
Con's...PPt don't think you can do motion path as you can on windows. This really is anoying. 
Word...no endnote yet. 
So currently I am running both office 04 and 08 on my computer, and both seem to run ok together. 
I do like the new version as its faster, but the old version is more stable. These issues hopefully 
will improve with software updates in near future. Endnote web-site shows that they are working on 
a integration.

The pro's - it is small and really doesn't take up much counter space.  It is very easy to clean.  Like the set up of it, with the blades being the lids you screw on.
The con's - it mushed veggies.  I followed the instructions exactly.  I made five batches of salsa tonight, and although some were marginally better than others, I would never serve it.  I used pulse technique a instructed.  BUT... ended up over=processing some things because other things were bouncing around whole and not getting chopped at all.  So tomatoes were total mush and onions were almost whole.
This is all I have made so far, but very disappointed as I was looking forward to having fresh salsa everyday.  
UPDATE - I've tried making additional things now.  It does make great scrambled eggs and veggies with cheese.
Made an iced mocha and it there were small ice particles throughout drink, which I didn't like.
Have learned to get better results by NOT doing things "by the book"  WHen making chicken salad or egg salad, I don't put the mayo in at all - that tends to gunk it up.  It works better in small batches, empty into bowl, and process more small batches.  Then I just add mayo, relish, whatever to the bowl itself and stir it together.  Works much better that way.
Made salsa last night.  Chopped the onions seperately, took them out, then put in all the other ingredients and pulsed them, then added them in bowl with onions and mixed together.  Much better results.
I would upgrade to 3 stars now.

This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)
      
I found this book to be somewhat interesting, but my biggest complaint is the lack of imagery. This book has so much potential for beautiful descriptions, but the way she just introduces places and continues the story does not do the settings justice. Indian Reservations have so much character and breath-taking views that it should be a sin to not spend time describing it to the readers that may have never gotten the chance to see one. Also the lack of description of other characters keeps me from connecting to them. Other than the odd action of mussing with their hair or comment on the paleness of the skin we really don't get a chance to see these characters. There is no image to go with them; the characters remain simply names.
Also, there seems to be a lack of personal traits and idiosynchrasies. I mean chracters are nice, nosy, happy, etc, but they don't seem to posses any little perk, so to speak, that makes them... well, them. I think things such as these would make the characters more relatable. It would also bring them to life and make them more well-rounded, for as of now they are fairly one-demensional characters.

I had used this on both my dogs.  About the 4th time, my pug/westie mix started jerking towards her hind/tail area (I had put most on the back of the neck and a small portion at the base of her tail).Since we had used this product before, we first thought  she had hip or back problems so took her to the vet and specialist.  After $1500 and 4 trips to the vet, including major pain medication she was better after a few days so assumed it was just a joint/back/hip problem that got better.  The next month, right after using Advantix again, the same thing happened which led to the obvious conclusion it was an alergic reaction.  I wished I had known it could be washed off with dish soap (per the earlier review) because she had to spend another 2 days until she stopped reacting to the treatment.

I bought this router about 9 monthes ago.  I chose Netgear because they are fairly cheap and still a decent company.  I could have purchased a 3com router for approximately the same price, but went to with the WGR614 because of the mail in rebate.  After recieving this router I mailed in the rebate.  After checking online my rebate was not accepted due to the fact that I did not submit a reciept.  I did in fact send in my amazon invoice, but I guess that isn't good enough.

You get what you pay for I guess. The caliper is made of cheap plastic, the readings can vary greatly depending simply on how much pressure you apply. The is a small button on the left hand side of the caliper that is supposed to "click" to let you know when you have pressed hard enough. The button was out of alignment with the caliper on the one I received, you almost have to bend it to get the button into the slot. I tried using it a bunch of times but I don't have any real faith in the measurements I'm getting with it. This one is a bust.

Bottom Line:  Drive failed within 1 hour.  Will return to J$R World for replacement or money back, not sure yet.  
Longer Story:  Was excited about getting a product that offered both Firewire and USB capabilities.  I purchased this drive partly due to the overwhelming favorable reviews.  Maybe I just got the one in a million bad drive, but not sure I'll go back to Iomega so quickly.  This device failed within the first hour after beginning to backup documents.  My computer somehow suddently failed to recognize the drive during the transfer.  Moved drive to two other computers and somehow the drive could be recognized but not used.  Kept asking to be formatted.  When I'd attempt to format the device it  would finish by saying drive was not successfully formatted.  There was no way to get around the problem or fix it.  Drive couldn't be formatted and drive couldn't be used without being formatted.  NOTE:  I also tried it back on the same machine where it originally failed.  Still didn't work.

The pan is "CHEAP".  That is, the non-stick stuff comes off.  This means, at the very least, that your bread sticks to the pan.  On the serious side, this stuff is in your bread and who knows the potential health effects of consuming it.  With the increasing incidence of many health problems including cancers, tumors, Altzheimer's, childhood diseases, who can say for sure that it's not caused by something as all-pervasive and seemingly benign as our cookware?  What about cookware that contributes little metal particles to your recipe?I haven't seen it warp yet but the V20 pan warped and I suspect that this one will warp as well over time (why wouldn't it, it's the SAME pan).  Summary: I've stopped using it and sold it at a yard sale.  Will purchase something different.

The only reason this coffee maker received two stars is for the convenience factor.  If you are considering a single serve system, run don't walk.  Run to the Tassimo by Braun.  The Tassimo reads a bar code for each type of coffee selected (latte, expresso,capaccino, etc.) and adds the perfect amount of water as well as separately steaming the milk for speciality coffee choices. You enjoy a perfect cup of coffee each time.  The Keurig, on the other hand, has a Mickey Mouse system: it only allows you to choose three cups sizes which means you get kind of watery coffee,very watery coffee,or dishwater. Our Keurig is not even worth "regifting."  We have, however, purchased a second Tassimo for our summer home and have also purchased two others as gifts.  Enjoy!

We have owned two of these.  They make perfect waffles, as many of the reviews have said.  The problem is that the top handle becomes loose.  It is attached by scres that have their heads inside the top of the waffle maker.  Once they become loose there is no way to re-tighten the handle.  Eventually it just falls off.  Our first one died within the warranty period.  The second one lasted until just beyond the warranty period.  It is a stupid design flaw on an otherwise wonderful product.

<review id="1480" label="0">
Just got the Griddler (GR-4) for Christmas, and have been putting it through some test runs.  The heating is too inconsistent due to several design flaws. These flaws are too significant for me, and I do not recommend this product. I am surprised by these design flaws, as I expected a high quality product, since this carries the "Cuisinart" name.
First, the plates do not have enough mass to maintain heat. The griddle plates each weigh about 18 ounces; while the grill plates weighed 22 ounces. For comparison, I have a waffle iron with removable plates (waffle side and flat griddle side) that weigh 26 ounces, but are 10-15% smaller than the Griddler's plates.
Second, the mass of the plates would not be as big as a concern if the heating element was more constantly "on." When the Griddler is ready (green light is on); the heating element turns off. The heating element does not turn on again for some time (a few to a several minutes, depending on the temperature and mass of the food being cooked).  In other words, this is like cooking on a frying pan that is heated to a certain temperature, then the pan is removed from the heat, and then the food is added to the pan. After a couple minutes, the pan is placed back on the heat source until it reaches the certain temperature. This type of on-and-off heating is fine for baking in an oven but not for a grill or griddle.
Third, the heating elements are insufficient. The elements are located in a single rectangular pattern, closer to the outside of the plates, than the inside. This flaw, along with the insufficient mass of the plates, causes food(or parts of such food) placed in the center of the Griddler to be less cooked than the outside edges. This is best shown when using the Griddler as a griddle and cooking large pancakes. The part of the pancake that was on the outside edge will be golden brown, while the part that was on the inner portion of the plate will be white. A larger heating element that snaked or coiled below the plates (instead of just a rectangular pattern) would sufficiently help with more even cooking of food.
Fourth, I found the temperature controls to be too low for cooking. Even at the highest setting for the griddle, pancakes would get barely golden brown. They would get done, but the color   (along with the inconsistent browning) would not make the pancakes presentable for a meal with guests.
These flaws do affect other foods, not just pancakes. For example, when I tried grilling a simple panini sandwich (hot ham and cheese sandwich), the coloration and grill marks were too inconsistent (yet the ham was hot and the cheese was melted). The flaws may be less noticeable in grilling some foods, such as hamburger patties or hotdogs, where the food is usually flipped 2-3 times.
In conclusion, the heating-related design flaws make this product not worth purchasing, especially if you are looking to use the product as griddle, or if "presentation" (e.g., color of food) is important to you. The Griddler may be a decent contact grill, but the uneven cooking is a deal-breaker for me. As of now, I will probably purchase a stove-top, cast iron, panini press to use instead of an electric panini grill.

I purchased Office 2007 Premium to upgrade my existing Office 2003 installation.  Installation went fine, and I worked with the product for a few weeks.  Then I wanted to use some templates--and found out that even though I spent a lot of money to purchase this product, IT DOES NOT COME WITH TEMPLATES!  You have to download them from MS Office online.  
When I tried to download the templates (resumes, brochures, etc.) the website finds my old 2003 installation and rejects the newer version, claiming that my product key is invalid.  There is no work-around for this, and I have yet to find a solution.  In other words, if you have a previous version of Office, none of the templates or online content are available to you.
How Microsoft would let a problem like this get through testing is beyond me.  It illustrates the incompetence that has become the norm for this organization (check out the Vista disaster).

I received the product undamaged. However, i failed to read the part of the description which states that is is equipped with the "u3" software. This stuff is garbage. It is too "buggy" and I have many issues trying to get the computer at work to recognize it. Work is running windows 2000 Pro. At home it did great with Vista. However the bottom line is the whole "u3" software is just bells and whistles. If you need to simply transfer non sensitive material to and from work stay away from "U3".

The My Book series is a class action lawsuit waiting to happen and I would be happy to join it. The design is so inferior that the drives get too hot and burn up - on both Mac and Windows. If it's under warranty, they send you a used, beat up replacement that someone else returned ... and the warranty does NOT start all over again. It applies only to your original piece of junk.
Customer "service" is based in India and the techies can't speak English.
I bought 3 of these and am considering legal action after the replacement also went belly up - very hot to the touch. It was my backup drive and now the backup is gone.
I used to sing the praises of WD, but never again. They care nothing about the customer - only about how money they can screw you out of.
If you have a My Book that has NOT fried yet, remove it from that horrible case so ti can stay cool. The warranty for it is worthless anyway. YouTube has a decent video on how to open the case and remove it. Search "remove My Book".

The keyboard is the stupidest design ever. I called HP to complain about the flaw in a dark brown colored keyboard that has lettering painted in a dark brown color, which makes typing anything, especially numbers, a serious hassle. What did the non technical support manager tell me? The keyboard is not a flaw, it was intentionally designed that way. If you don't like it, then you can return the product. Nice to see how HP is out to please the customer, when apparently they feel cocky and arrogant in this economy that they can tell a customer, "If you don't like it, then buy something else." No more HP products for me, and by word of mouth I won't recommend their products to anyone else either.
By the way, the same bronze colored computer sells at Sam's club, but with white letters on the keyboard. If it wasn't a design flaw, then why is the problem fixed on those computers sold at the retail giant?? My advice to anyone else is, complain to the CEO of HP, cause management doesn't care.

The main reason I bought this drive instead of others is that it does not have a lid for the USB connector. The mechanism is such that if you push up the button on the side, the USB connector pops out. I found the following problems with my drive (within 3 days of use)
1) The USB port on the my Kingston DataTraveler doesn't connect reliably to any USB port on any computer. There seems to be some loose contact always.
2) The USB connector is supposed to "lock" so that the connector doesn't go into the device (instead of the USB female port on the computer or whatever) when you try to plug in the USB drive. The locking mechanism isn't reliable on mine and at times the connector gets pushed into the memory stick itself instead of the USB female port on my laptop.
3) This USB memory device is a little big. If you have two adjacent USB ports on your computer and this device is plugged into one of them the other USB port on your computer is blocked and rendered unusable.

I could not help but notice over a hundred reviews, many short and uninformative, raving about this product posted a day apart for weeks on end. This, after Smart Money ran an expose' on false positive reviews online.
That said, I did buy this in hopes of making a nasty job easier and it is a good idea. But in reality it does not really save any time and, after a month of rolling it, my wife and I ended up removing the screen and just scooping it like any other litter box. The reviews that mention that it leaks when you roll it are correct, though some litters that have less dust are not as bad. The review that states that it creates another mess by coating the inside walls with litter dust is correct also. For the product to work well, it needed to have been made of a more rigid plastic with a gasket to seal the dust in where the top and bottom connect. But even if it worked as advertised as seemingly "hundreds" of reviews would have you believe, you still have a drawer of messy litter to dispose of which means you just have one BIG scoop instead of several smaller ones, you periodically have to take it apart and scoop the litter that sticks inside, and because of the rolling, you have to take the whole thing apart and clean it as well.

when we got the eeepc today my 15 year old daughter's first question was if it is a toy computer or a real one. most reviews here feel that $300 is sooooo cheap. actually for what you are getting its not. 
PRO: i was kind of impressed about the way linux was implemented on this little machine. the small display is actually not bad, bright and sharp. has just about every program you would need on the road already installed, like skype, chat clients, word processing, wlan, games, media players, etc.
CON: the look and especially the feel is somewhat 'cheap'.  after only a couple hours, the mouse keys stopped to work as did the tapping function on the keypad. big bummer. the screen and the keyboard is really too small to do any kind of serious work for any length of time.
all my other computers are macs, i might just be totally spoiled by the (usually) excellent apple build quality.
UPDATE: after pondering if i should return this for an exchange or refund i decided to return it. for only $100 more i bought a certified reconditioned dell inspiron 1525 laptop with 15" wxga, 120gb hard drive, etc.

Having gone through two WRT610N routers in two days, I can confirm this router is faulty and not ready for real-world use. I tested it in an environment with new MacBook Pros (gigabit ethernet and wireless N capability) and Windows PCs, and the wireless signal drops out constantly requiring me to reboot the router. At one point, after rebooting the router, it reset all of its settings to factory defaults. On other occasions the 5 Ghz band disappeared completely, requiring a reboot as well. I have experienced exactly the same problems with both routers (the first one and its replacement). So now I am forced to replace it with another brand/model.
I have spoken with Linksys support supervisors and Level II technicians for hours, and none has been able to come up with a solution. Moreover, I have tried soft resets, hard resets, firmware upgrades and configuring the wireless bands with different channels and encryption types, to no avail.
Please be advised that there are serious problems with the WRT610N router that Linksys needs to address immediately. It has not been thoroughly tested.

I did and the new one one made (notice past tense) great coffee and now after a month it is making watery coffee. Why I don't know seems like a pretty basic operation.

I guess i'm not really the cerebral type.  Went to see this with my kids and am not sure who wanted to get out of that theatre more, them or me.  Hardly any talking in the film.  If i had a gun with me in the theatre, i would end it all there and then.

My wife bought me this mixer as a Christmas present.  It was to be an upgrade from my trusty old 4.5 quart KitchenAid mixer I've had for almost twenty years.  This new one doesn't deserve to wear the KitchenAid name.  
On the weekends I bake bread and bagels.  Old trusty can plow through 5 or 6 batches of bagel dough without a problem.  The new "pro" model can't even make it through two before switching off from overheating.  Also it gives off an odor half way through the first batch.  The recipe I use is from an old issue of Cook Illustrated, in the article they state they use a KitchenAid mixer. Also the recipe uses a mere 4 cups of flour.  
If you really want one of these I'm considering leaving mine at the end of the driveway with a FREE sign on it. May save my pennies for Hobart (they owned KitchenAid back when my old mixer was made.)

I purchased this drive based on the positive feedback, but have not been able to sync it with my mac.  I have gone on line to email the problem, and have followed directions to format disk, but without success.  I attempted to contact company by phone and was told to call back later even though they have 24 hour service.  I am unable to use the drive and unable to return it.  For mac users, I would avoid this product.

This review is from: The Princess Bride - Dread Pirate Edition (DVD)
      
On May 11, 2006 Reviewer: D. Crepeau "dreamer54321" (MO)wrote: "... meaning that the "widescreen" is not true widescreen. It's the same thing as standard screen, except with black bars over the top and bottom portion of the screen. A true widescreen would have none of the top or bottom picture cut off, but give extra information on the sides. 
But a great movie. That's why 5 stars. The movie is excellent."
well, the film was origianaly filmed in 1.85.1 and the dvd release is in 1.85.1 so where do you come up w/ the idea that it was boxed? (boxing is stupid and defaces a film - just look at what a generation watched on tv as the "standard version" of gone w/ the wind!) but in this case this wasn't done. i couldn't find the post that you were answering but your info on this is not correct.
as for the film. it was an instant classic w/ built in kitch. knowing that the same choriographer (or son of) that choriographed erroll flynn was cool enough for me to check it out (big flynn fan). very glad i did. it's one of those rare "perfect" films.

I bought this product primarily as a digital scale. It was well reviewed on the Amazon website, but if your primary interest is weighing yourself on a daily basis, then get something else. After  a few days, I returned it - it's way too complicated.

First off, the aesthetics and form factor of this device are outstanding. It also appears to be a reasonable value given combination of portability, storage capacity and firewire 400 and usb2.0 connectivity. That's the good part. The rest of the review points out the negatives.
There are several things that annoy me about this product. First up is the firewire interface. Instead of providing a standard 6 pin interface, what you get is 1 firewire 4 pin plus 1 usb 2.0 interface on the device. In order connect the drive via firewire, you are forced to use their special firewire/usb hybrid cable. The usb interface powers the device while data is passed over firewire. This is bad in case you lose the cable or just find the provided one too short. My guess is this is going to be a tough item to find at the local electronics retailer.
Next, up is the capacity gauge. Why they put the thing on the "back" next to the interface ports is beyond me. Would have been much nicer to have it located up front so that you don't have to twist the device around backwards, limiting the reach of your already too short supplied cable.
Final point on the capacity gauge. It is designed with 4 lights so that an active light at position 1 indicates 0%-25% full, position 2 indicates 25%-50%, and so on. Simple right? WRONG. Suppose I accidently flip the device bottom up? Now a %25 full drive appears %75 full and vice versa. Now I have to think "am I using the product the way the design engineers intended?" Would have made much more sense to have the lights fill from left to right so that lights 1,2, and 3 together would indicate %75 full. 
For a product aimed at apple customers, Western Digital apparently paid far too little time testing ease of use. While the drive works as advertised, there are too many annoying aspects for me to recommend the product.

I was very excited to recieve my CHI straightner which I had heard so much about.  When I recieved it promptly in the mail, I plugged it in and it would not turn on.  Also the red bulb for the on indicator light was missing.  So I never got to try it.  When I returned it, I was told that the seller did not have a replacement.  The item was a bit flimsy and I am wondering if it might have been an imposter.  I am sorry I didn't get to try a "CHI"

Like the other reviews on this page, the new nano seems to be a step backward not forward. I usually have my Ipod in my car hooked to my stereo, now I have to bring it in each night to recharge the stupid thing becasue it can't take power from the cord it once did before. I tried it in my girlfriends stereo (different brand) same thing. I have never really been happy with Apple products and this just solidified the fact that I will probably never buy from them again. As for now my 1st generation 2GB nano will stay in my car and my "new" 16GB nano will be a paper weight on my desk until the few times I go snowboarding and use it.
a waste of $200 if you ask me.

I just bought a 17" Macbook Pro from a local reseller.  This is my first Apple and I am replacing a Toshiba Satellite that has done me justice for these past 7 years.   I guess I can say my first 1 HOUR experience with this Apple was not so cozy.  The screen had troubles.  The brightness basically did not come to life... it never reached a brightness that I could see the menues on the screen completely.  Tried everything, brightness control, restart, everything the manual instructed.   I called Apple tech support, and the lady on the phone simply was short and unhelpful to me and left me with a unpositive experience (mind you I was open for suggestions and help because I reallllly wanted to get this cool computer to work).  So I took it back to the reseller and hopefully they do me justice...  they need to make sure they get an "RA" number from Apple before they can do anything.  Luckily, the second Apple tech support person I called from the reseller was a little more helpful but the computer still was broken out of the box.  So, the ball is in Apple's court I guess.  I hope that Apple will do the right thing and give an "RA" to the reseller and  just replace this computer with a "new" one.  So, this review will be completed at a later date, either with a Macbook Pro in hand or another brand i.e. Toshiba.

I loved Twilight! I thought the middle books were ok. This last book made me crazy! I know this is ridiculous but I was actually mad half way into this book!
First, I don't know if I am the first to say this or not but, after book 2 I didn't feel there was any substance to Edward and Bella. He thinks she's beautiful, she can't believe he wants her, and so on. They mostly disagreed and had awkward moments. Jacob and Bella were truly friends, they had honest exchanges. Maybe I am a cynic but the "true love, soulmate" thing didn't hold for me. I kinda hoped the 4th book would give Edward and Bella more substance because I was, of course, rooting for Edward. This last book did nothing of the sort!
I felt the pregnancy was a bad plot twist. I suppose in a way it made Bella less selfish but only slightly. The worst plot twist was Jacob imprinting on Renesmee. I was truly disgusted. I also felt it was a cheap way to let Bella off the hook. She really had no conflict in this book that she did in previous books. The imprinting allowed Bella to have quite literally everything without losing a thing. Well, I guess she lost her humanity.
After Bella becomes a vampire she becomes maybe slightly less whiny but she loses everything that was Bella. Too quickly she's an unrecognizable character. Instead of being unsure, whiny, self centered and self sacrificing, Bella becomes a perfect, surprisingly controlled, motherly vampire. WHAT?!?!?
Edward is like a wall flower. Jacob is suddenly over everything because he's imprinted on Bella's infant child. All too quickly, Edward even moves past that disgusting detail. Rosalie becomes even more creepy. Ugh, I just can't believe how disappointing this book was!!
Lastly, the writing... Lacking for lack of a better word. Lacking detail, lacking focus, lacking direction. It seemed scattered. The end was anti-climatic. Any build-up was wasted. 
So there you have it. I will still be watching the Twilight movie when it comes out this month and I hope they do a good job with it.

I was a Pampers lover,but not anymore. I used Pampers diaper more than three years for my first one and again for second one. But, it looks like the company makes thin diaper recently. As another mom says,"if the diaper gets too full, they just burst and the absorbant material goes everywhere." I absolutely agree with her. Therefore, I cancelled subscription and changed to another brand.

<review id="1550" label="0">
Leider ist die Gr��e 7 von Pampers nicht wirklich gr��er als die hier in Europa angebotene Gr��e 6. Sie ist, was das Saugvlies betrifft, eher schmaler und d�nner. 
Welche Alternativen bieten sich den Eltern von einn�ssenden Schulkindern?
Z.B. eine zus�tzliche Vlieswindel mit in die Pampers legen und ggf. ein Gummih�schen dr�ber -- besonders dann, wenn sich die Verschl�sse aufgrund des gewachsenen Kinderk�rpers nicht mehr schlie�en lassen. Ist vielleicht nicht die Ideall�sung, aber allemal besser als dem P&amp;G-Konzern f�r eine minderwertige Windel (Gr. 7) das Geld in den Rachen zu schieben.

<review id="1551" label="0">
My 21 year old daughter bought me the entire set of books.  She is enamored with Edward.  I understand.  He's a very compelling character - he's beautiful, perfect, brilliant, protective, inhumanely strong and agile, enigmatic, the ultimate bad-boy with a heart of gold, and he has an amazing backstory and an inhumanly beautiful, loyal and loving adopted family.  I get it - he's every adolescent girl's dream.  And wonder of wonders, he never ages.  The series is more or less about the inexplicable attraction of soul mates, inexplicable because I cannot for the life of me figure out what makes Bella attractive aside from the fact that Edward can't read her mind and she smells enticing.  
Perhaps it's my age, but I believe three things - the first is regarding a work of fantasy - an author must stay true to his or her fantasy.  You cannot break the your own rules to give the reader what you think the reader wants.  A fantasy is exactly that, make-believe...a dream, but even so, as a writer you must stay true to the rules you establish for your own fantasy.  Ms. Meyer breaks her own rules.
Second, characters must develop and mature.  There must be a larger reason for events in a story and that larger reason cannot simply be so the hero can constantly save the heroine - which is the case here.  It gets very old.  Bella does not change and grow.  From beginning to end she remains the same apathetic, cynical, whiny, helpless, martyred female she was when she arrived in Forks.  Except when she's with Edward and then she superglues herself to his side in a manner that seems much more like the way a drug addict needs a fix than true love.  She gets her happy ending but I'm left wondering what she will do with it.  Anything redeeming?  I very much doubt it.
Third, I want my characters fleshed out.  In my opinion, Jacob was the most three-dimensional character in the entire series and at times he was written in such a way that he became almost repellent to me.  Throughout all four books, the same superficial descriptive words, the same sappy love-sick-puppy feelings that are supposed to pass for mature, timeless love, the same scenes are repeated ad nauseam.  I would have liked to see the Cullens, other than Carlisle, do more with the their eternal existence than simply repeating experiences and 'hunting'.  Oh, and saving Bella for some unknown reason.  I assume they became attached to Bella because they loved Edward and he loved her, so as Laurent said to Bella in the second book - she was kind of a pet of theirs.  I expect more from my female leads. Through four books I wanted Bella to mature, to become more 'human' than she was when the series began.  But I'm sorry to say she never did.  Edward always seemed more human and more compassionate to me and his character was diminished as the series went on.  
If you can get past the flawed writing, the concept works, especially in the first book.  Other than Jacob Black, I was disappointed with the remainder of the story.  Vampire world ain't all that exciting.  From what I could tell, their larger society consisted of a bunch of overgrown, temper-tantrum prone, immature, super-powered children (I'm including the ancient vampires with the papery skin) who murder a lot of people.  Their rules are simple - keep the secret.  That's it folks.   Would it be too much to expect that after living for millennia these vampires might develop some special perspective or philosophy greater  than - we don't eat the neighbors?
Okay, rant finished.

If I can stop just one person from buying an Attack 3, I'll be satisfied. Thinking that third time's a charm, I'm on my third stick in five months. Same problem every time. It's fine for a week, until like others have said, the X-axis starts behaving erratically, and eventually becomes uncontrollably wild. I've even gone so far as using third-party software to try and adjust the dead-zones and calibration readings. Alas, the Attack 3 overcomes them all, the sensor readings are rabidly epileptic, and beyond help. If you're looking for a budget stick, STAY AWAY. If you own one, take it back, it doesn't get better or 'settle in'. This stick is going back for the third time and I will no longer buy any Logitech products. I'd have been happy to pay an extra $20 for a well made, durable controller, but Logitech have contracts with every major store to sell this piece of junk and other, slightly higher priced junk, so buying an alternative brand is a hassle, a goose chase and a long drive.Edit: To electronics fan - you misread my review. The Attack 3 works great - for about a week. Try using it for something that requires quick changes in direction for long periods of time, a racing game for example. You can't exactly test out the stick gently ambling along in a 747. The calibration readings become erratic and then unusable. It's not my system, because there's other reviewers out there that have the same problems. Search Google. I'll say it again - a cheap stick, with cheap components and awful quality control. Best avoided.

I have had an awful experience with this camcorder worse yet with Sony Custome Service. I shot multiple tapes of irreplacable content and discovered that the transport was defective and that the mic pics up a constant rumble. Sony customer service was completely unresponsive and refused to replace the camera but insisted a service call of indeterminate length was what was in order. They had me appeal to their "Executive Review Board". Their answer was a curt "Service  take it or leave it" I won't ever buy another Sony product. I urge you to do the same. P.S.  The cameras performance wasn't anything special either.

I had read a few earlier reviews that said this flash drive is compatible with ReadyBoost.  The reviews are usually accurate so I assumed they were right but that was a mistake.  This flash drive is NOT compatible with ReadyBoost (I just confirmed with the Kingston website).
Also, the clip seems too flimsy for a keyring.  In fact it seems too flimsy even for a strap (they really should have made it thicker and widened the opening).

I am returning the second player in two months, both played for a week or so then died.  I am not getting another one.
i got this for my daughter for Christmas, thinking "why buy an $$$ Ipod" for a kid in middle school who might easily misplace it or have it stolen?  The reviews of the 1 gig were great. 2gig sounded better.
Within a month it stopped working.  The screen was an unreadable smear.  Amazon promptly took it back, sent a new one.  daughter was slow to reload it (disgusted with previous failure)  two weeks later it wont start.  checked the battery, its still good.
we are done with this.  Customer service may be great but having it fail and having to return the dang thing (and deal with angst about "what did i do to it?" answer: nothing.  Other reviews note how durable it is. Well, not for us.

This toaster originally worked just fine, but 18 months out, it has started making a horrible noise in the convection fan.  And of course this is just outside the 12 month warranty.  Their customer support was useless -- "It's probably cheaper to buy a new one than have this one serviced.  There are no Sanyo small appliance service centers".   I'll tell you right now we're not going to replace it with anything from Sanyo!!

In terms of what it's used for I think it's good (not great). Some pros and cons:
Pros:
-It brews coffee really fast.
-Thermal carafe is an excellent. keeps warm for long time.
-Timer comes in very handy
Cons:
-I had to exchange due to leak in the carafe lid and even the exchaned one is leaking too (not as bad as first one though). it's an internal leak where water/coffee sips into the lid whereI can't get it out. this is the reason for 2star.
-Too tall. it barely fints under my kitchen cabinet (miner)
-puring the water is not as good as other coffee makers I've used before. there is no way to measure water amout you are pouring unless you use measuring cup.
Anyways, that's my review. if it was for lid leaking I would say it would get 3 stars but leaking lid is not acceptable, especially 2 in a row.

The wireless access always drops your connection.  I tried experimenting with G only, B only, and mixed all to no improvement.  I tried upgrading the firmware only to find no improvement.  Its absolutly maddening to consistently lose your connection to your router ever 2 minutes at times.  Other times are even worse, I have to connect to my neighbor because my wireless won't even acknowledge me.  It will show full bars for signal strength and still no use.  
Another friend of mine had a similar experiences with this, went out and bought the most generic brand-X router, a motorola but I don't think he has wireless-G on it. He has no problem with a great stable connection now and I'm purple with jealousy.

I installed and tried to use this new version.  The user interface is completely different.  I went online at Microsoft to see what this was all about.  They call it a "Ribbon".  What a mess.  I can't find anything.
It seems like it takes me so much extra time to do the most basic operations.  If you have an older version of Office and it is working well for you, I highly recommend just sticking with it until Microsoft fixes it somehow.  After reading reviews at other sites, I can't believe it actually had 4 stars on Amazon.  On CNET, it was 5 out of 10.  I wish I would have read these reviews before I purchased it.  I felt like I was driving a car with square wheels.  If it isn't broken, don't break it.  The file conversion thing is also a lot of trouble to deal with.

I tried everything.  After figuring out what my cat's favorite kind of treat was, I loaded the ball with them.  My cat simply didn't care.  He looked at it for a couple seconds and walked away from it.  I then added some catnip.  He played with it for maybe seven or eight seconds and lost interest.  I tried catnip spray, tossing it to the cat, attaching it to a string and any number of other tricks, but nothing worked.  I thought that it would give my indoor cat some exercise, but nothing helped.  He just couldn't be bothered.  I then gave it to a friend with multiple cats.  My friend actually had some luck.  I guess that his cats were concerned that the other cats would get the treats first, so they actually used the ball and managed to get some treats out of it.
In short, the only reason that a cat would use this ball, at least as far as my experience can demonstrate, is so that another cat will not be able to get the treats within.  It is an ugly statement about the nature of cats (just kidding).
I guess that my family will be sticking with fuzzy strings on the ends of sticks for our cat.

the dlink dir-615 router is flakey if it's not often dropping connection it's failing to maintain proper link via wired connection and after hardware revision a1 the model with the black and silver face they removed the only real good option on this router the content filtering.
send your router out rma and you get the newer revision which lacks this feature and gives off an annoying voltage hum for those who can hear and are bothered by that (often techs) let-alone the poor transmit.

I will go back to my linksys wrt54g (linksys's most common model)  and toss this d-link doorstop into the closet maybe someone has a firmware hack to make it useful (like dd-wrt)
simply put a waste of money i got this from the crooks clearing out compusa so yea i can't return it  
lesson learned don't waste money on cruddy dlink routers 
the best i've reviewed for the average joe or jane that you can get at any office max or what not is
1.linksys     (some of there n units kinda suck but my wrt54g g router is common and one of the better ones plus you can put dd-wrt on it making it extremely useful)

I gave the book two stars because the author knows how to write and how to entice a young audience by using "Romeo and Juliet" for her outline, but other than that, the series is all fluff and doesn't even include accurate information. For instance, who ever heard of an elk bull (not buck--that's deer) with two dozen points (and they're tines, not antlers)? Unbelievable! Someone needs to do a bit of research before they write stuff like that. Since it's a fantasy romance series, it really doesn't matter whether or not an imaginary vampire can impregnate the main character, etc., but at least the author should get real facts straight.
Other than that, everything in the story is predictable, the main character is so stupid, whiny and fragile that you want to slap her, and like other people mentioned, there's really no appeal to her whatsoever, so why would the other characters in the story find her so alluring? I hope teenage girls are smarter than this and don't look to this character as a hero. 
The sad thing is that teenagers will infer from the book that people are liked because of their looks and not because they are of strong character or because they can communicate effectively with others. The lack of communication within relationships in the story was quite disturbing, but apparently that's why romances sell so well.

This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)
      
After reading this book and Twilight, I have come to the conclusion that what makes these books so appealing to young GIRL readers is their simplicity in structure.  Overall, I thought New Moon was an enjoyable read, but not because it was so thought provoking and unpredictable--only because it was so simple and easy to read (a true beach read).  Bella closely resembles a Harlequin Romance Heroine--unable to function without her man.  I like the author's "cryptic" naming of Bella-meaning a "beautiful swan"; however, I just wish she were a "beautiful swan".  Instead, she is pandering to the wants and desires of a man-rather than being a strong female (and a good role model for all the young girls reading this novel)  I just wish in this book her protracted state of despair over Edward's leaving wouldn't have been quite so, well, protracted!  I sincerely hope that Stephenie Meyers gives Bella a little more pizazz and spunk in the next book.  I can't honestly recommend this to any young girl because of the "need my man to survive" effect that rings throughout the entire novel.

Where to start....????  SO many things are messed up in Office 2007.
Here are my top 3:
#1: Word/Excel/PPt: The ribbon interface changes things around so drastically that doing what was once simple things in Office XP/2003 is now a frustrating exercise in lost time and productivity.  
#2: Excel:  First, MS has a hotfix (a 32 MB download) for a math error (yes a math error).  Very few users will ever be likely to hit that value range on a calculated result, but still unacceptable for a mainstream number crunching program. But if you are one of those unfortunates, and the error ocurrs in a very large, complex spreadsheet, then the error could cost a business a fortune if it's not caught.
#3: Excel crashes if you try to specify a custom value range for chart error bars by selecting the appropriate row/columns from the worksheet (like you can in previous versions)... you have to enter them manually by typing the arcane "=Sheet1!$A$1:$Z$1".  Even if you try to click over to the worksheet while the entry box is open Excel will crash and you lose everything since the last Save.  This bug is probably lurking in other areas as many functions make the same calls to a common software modules where the bug really is located.
There are many other bugs in this product too numerous to list here (goto the MS Discussion Groups on Office 2007 for more).
Do not buy MS Office 2007 unless you like PAIN!!

I had this keyboard for about a year and I loved it.  It is as cool looking as they say.
Then about a month ago I had to throw it away.  I am a college student and I was working on a research paper when it started typing keys I wasn't touching and then certain keys quit working at all.  I had to use an old keyboard that the keys stick until I could get a new one.

I am so dissappointed with this book.  I absolutely devoured the other 3 and was one of the 40 year old midnight book purchasers.  I kept reading this thinking that A. She didn't even write it. or B.  She certainly didn'
t run this by anyone.  It was such a let down.  My love affair with this series was was stolen from me.  It feels like a 750 page bird crap landed on my head.  Like many fans have already said, Jacob imprinting on their child, get an abortion and you can have sex with my wife, the creepy way the baby was talking to them so early, the name Nessie. I could go on and on.  Man this book could have been so much better. Absolutlely no magic.  I think I will toss it in the fire and keep re-reading the other 3.

First wireless router that I've ever had that just doesn't work. Constant errors, and disconnects....very unstable. In the business environment I use this in, it is totally unacceptable. Went back to my old router which doesn't have the range I'd like, but it's stable.

This past Christmas I bought my daughter a 500 gig Seagate external hd from Officemax, and was told that the hd wd be perfectly compatible with her Mac Powerbook.  I was also told that a small download from Seagate wd enable her to access the desktop feature that pc's cd access right off.  Well, her Powerbook never did recognize or acknowledge that she had plugged in the hd. So, I decided to order from Amazon the same Seagate 500 gig  hd but especially for Mac. Guess what?  Same results.  Yes, her Powerbook does meet the requirements which Seagate recommends.  This product may be ok for Macbooks and Macbook Pros, but it does not seem to work very well with the Powerbook as it claims it should.  I told her to pack it up and return it.

What a waste of the huge talent line up! The first 10 minutes are indeed funny as many have pointed out but it's downhill all the way thereafter - 2 hours of downhill. Perhaps I didn't understand things. I'm a Brit and have lived in the US for 15 years and should have no problem with comprehension. I understood about 50% of what was said - and 100% of the frequent use of the F and S words. Steve Coogan, the wonderful Alan Partridge, was completely wasted.
Don't buy it, don't rent it, don't bother to go to a theater. This is an expensive waste of time.

i want to give this a higher rating as it is reasonably priced and fulfills a niche that is necessary.  my particular machine at least is not so "ultra quiet".  i read the manual and tried their suggestions about how to make it less noisy.  i think the noticeable noise is just part of the design.  it is definitely noticeable when the living room gets quiet.  i know they could have designed this to be truly "ultra quiet". too bad.  i probably end up junking this machine when the annoyance of the machine grows to be too much.  i bought it so cheap at $16.99, that it is not worth the hassle to package and ship it back.

I was incredibly disappointed by the third installment in this series.  I loved "Twilight" and liked "New Moon."  However, I ended up putting down "Eclipse" about 3/4 of the way through.  It seemed like everything in this book wasn't as good as it was in the first 2 - the writing, the characters, the plot.  I found myself simply not liking ANY of the major characters.  Bella is whiny and needy, Edward is controlling beyond belief, Jacob is not even the same character we first met in "Twilight."  The writing itself is bland and unimaginative.  I finally decided to stop reading the book when I realized that I just didn't care what happened.  Another reviewer wrote that they wished they had stopped reading the series with number 1, and I have to agree.

This coffeemaker makes great coffee, but it is too tall which makes filling the water reservoir difficult. However, the biggest problem is the leakage of water from the steam under the lid of the unit. It leaks water every time you raise the lid even if you let it sit for hours after brewing the coffee. The water tends to leak down the backside of the unit and all over the electrical cord. I wish I had listened when I read the other reviews on this item as others had already had the same complaint. It is not just a LITTLE water, but a real electrical hazard to say nothing of the constant mop up it needs each time you brew coffee!

I expected a lot more power in everyway but I am a little disappointed to check at a poor performance.

I bought the bread machine with the highest rating, so had high expectations. My first loaf was a soggy, compact, 2 inch high reject with no browning on the top crust. I discovered that most if not all of the yeast was still in the yeast dispenser. The next day I made another attempt. This time I mixed the yeast with a small amount of the flour and put it in the bottom of the pan. I also checked the temperature of the water and raised it to 72 degrees F. (My tap water is 55.) Imagine my disappointment when the nice smelling loaf turned out to be another soggy dud! Sorry. I do better the old fashioned way. I'm returning the bread machine.

This review is from: Gone with the Wind (Two-Disc Edition) (DVD)
      
No matter how long this movie is it still wasn't long enough to be true to the book. How could they cut two of Scarlett's children? I'm so glad I read the book first because if I'd seen this mess first I probably never would have bothered. The book was just cut to pieces. And this movie is a classic?      Vivian Leigh was a terrible Scarlett. I could hardly stand to watch her. This movie was overacted and just plain terrible. Read the book instead. At least then you get the whole, complete story.

This review is from: Wall-E (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)
      
Wall-E.  It looked cute in the previews, so we bought it sight unseen.  One of these days, I'll learn NOT to do that.  Starship Troopers 2 should've been the capper, but sometimes I have to learn the hard way.  
Wall-E is enigmatic. He is diligent. He is curious. He is easy to love.  My problem with this film is that the story elements are very deep and heavy for smaller children, but moreover, they were wholly awful to watch if you have even half a heart.  I have to say that I failed to derive much enjoyment at all from this film, and what I did, was killed by the horror of the "message." 
People [Americans] too fat to WALK, living aboard a robot-run ship while a single Wall-E unit attempts to clean up the messy planet mankind has left behind.  
No mention is made of other countries or their populous, but the accents of those aboard the Axiom [a proposition considered to be self-evident] were purely American.  
And in the end, [SPOILERS] when people return to Earth, it's to the same filth-ridden earth they left 700 years prior, with the same problems, and with a total lack of knowledge of how to survive.  OH, and they're too FAT to WALK.  Lest we forget. [/SPOILERS]
I was appalled with this "work," and genuinely hope that, from now on, Pixar goes back to the CHILDREN'S MOVIE venue, and leaves the aggressive fire and brimstone environmentalist crap to Greenpeace and Earth First.

I was very excited to see this production only to be dissapointed by the bad choice of camera angles and too much "Shakey Cam".  I have yet to get pass the first three episodes.  I undrestand the effect they were going for, use of a steady cam to simulate actually "being there" but to use it when a couple is lying in bed having a conversation is ridiculous.  I found it annoying to watch.  The crooked camera angles are reminiscent of the old 60's Batman series.  I found it very distracting from the story being told that I just had to turn it off.

All reviews for wireless products seem to run the gamut from great to terrible. I would like to provide my input, but your experience may differ.
I purchased 3 of these in a row (over a week period). The first one I got working for a bout 2 weeks, then it started to drop the signal, causing me to have to power cycle the unit. I called Tech Support, and after about 30 minutes of troubleshooting, the tech support person said the unit must be faulty and that I should return it. I did so, and the second unit would not connect to the internet, and after another 30 minutes on the phone with tech support, the tech support person said the unit must be faulty and that I should return it. Having seen so many rave reviews of this product I assumed I was just having a run of bad luck and got another one of these. I had the exact same experience.
I returned the Linksys unit and purchased a D-Link D-634M, and it worked within minutes of being out of the box. I have had no issues for the last 2 months.
Not sure if the store I was going to had a bad batch or what.

The HD-DVD and Blu-ray versions lack the "110 minutes of 'behind the scene' footege" + a documentary entitled "Planet Earth -- The Future". Full descriptions of these from amazon's websites are as follows:
"DVD Features:
110 minutes of behind the scenes footage - one 10-minute behind the scenes program for each episode (SD release only)
Documentary:Planet Earth - The Future: This 3-part, 2 1/2 hour series looks at what the future may hold for endangered animals, habitats and -- ultimately -- ourselves. Following the environmental issues raised by Planet Earth, it asks why so many species are threatened and how they can be protected in future. (SD release only)"
My friend bought the DVD set as a gift, and we started to watch this extraordinarily exceptional documentary series. Among all other things, the part that we most liked was those "behind the scene footages" because there are some utterly and literally unbelievable scenes captured that make you wonder how they were captured, and after each episode these footages tell you about the techniques used for videotaping. As a frequent documentary watcher, I was really puzzled with how these series were videotaped, and the footages shed light to many things.
Since I liked this series very much, I went to BestBuy and quarelled with a sales associate for the exhange of this DVD set with the Blu-ray one. Eventually I win, but when I came to my apartment, ultimately she won, because the footages were missing in the Blu-ray edition!!!
BBC, first and foremost, what made you think that Blu-ray player owners do not require or less require the bonus feautres??
Second, if you ever had to consider whether DVD player owners or Blu-ray player owners less need the bonus feautres, then how come you voted against the latter?? After all the bonus feautres constantly praise how you videotaped in HD!!
As to the narrators, I have not watched the series on TV, nevertheless I share the same opinion with others, as a non-American.
Why are you compelling these guys to watch the series in British English. I could respec`t your decision if you had sticked to British English for the TV broadcasting. But broadcasting with a U.S. narrator and then releasing the DVD with a Brit narrator is simply deceiving people.
Anyhow, for the prospective buyers I will, irrespective of the HD quality, recommend the DVD set instead of Blu-ray. Believe me, the DVD series was also very nice. Not to mention that another reviewer comments that the visual quality on this Blu-ray is far worse than the then TV broadcasting. He relies his facts on the encoding. I don't know whether he is true or not, but it is better to consider his comments as well.

LaCie mkes a great product, but packaged with poor software, minimal instructions and hardware/software that ultimately did not work was a killer for this product. I was looking for an external hard drive that I could keep at home and access over the internet. I have an Apple Airport Extreme and an iMAC of which the "Ethernet Disk Mini Home Edition" was connected to the Extreme via GB Ethernet. So far so good. After the software failed to recognize the existence of the newly installed hard drive for about 3 attempts, it all of a sudden recognized it. Yeah, great, now let's get this thing running.
The skimpy instructions comprised about 10% of what I had to dig up on the internet to even get close to getting this thing to work. After a couple of hours, opening up several ports, and entering a bunch of poorly documented parameters into LaCie's host site, it finally, sort of worked.
Every time I got into the LaCie Home Drive with my MacBook Pro, I would have to log in. Not a problem. Very slow data transfers, but it did actually limp along with the iMAC in sleep mode. The problem started with the inconvenience of having to log in from my local iMAC to access the local LaCie Home drive. Not just once, but for each and every folder on the drive. Nuts! Again there was extremely slow data transfer rates.
Next I decided to change some of the security setups, like a different password. Fine, except the lame software again failed to recognize the existence of the hard drive. Forevermore the drive couldn't be seen by their own software. Then after too many futile attempts to get their software to work, the iMAC eventually couldn't log into the hard drive.
Keep in mind, that everything in the initial setup was painfully slow too. Each individual parameter gets written to the drive one parameter at a time. First comes the password - and it takes 10 minutes? Next parameter - and it takes another 10 minutes? Come on guys. Hello! It's right over here! Setup took about 7 to 8 hours - full of frustration as you could imagine.
The answer to remote data access by several computers of the MAC variety is to open a ".MAC" account. .MAC is fast, well behaved, packed with tons of features that are simple to set up and use, and it's convenient. If you love your MAC and Leopard, you will love setting up .MAC (about 15 minutes for the pair of MAC's) and using it's rich features.
The other LaCie hard drives are fast and reliable and have always been a favorite of mine, but this one is rendered into a dumb brick by extremely poor and incomplete software, questionable hardware, and a frustratingly difficult user interface when it decides to limp along on its terms.
I may have gotten a lemon, but there are too many things going on here and should be a warning for consumers to look elsewhere.

I think this toy has potential, but it didn't come as pictured. The rope is not actually a rope, it's a plastic mimic of a rope and my dog can't seem to figure out that he can tug at it like he can his tug rope.

Mine had a loose screw as well - there was no way for me to figure out it was a returned unit or LaCie really has a quality control problem that it consistently produce units with a loose screw... Either way, it's really not helping LaCie. On top of that, Windows XP does not recognize the drive at all. I would find out if it would work with Vista if it were not for that loose screw. LaCie really needs to look into these!

I absolutely LOVED the first three books, but Breaking Dawn kind of ruined it for me. I was used to the fact that Bella and Edward were in love, but it went to a sickeningly sweet pinnacle in this book. I seriously had to skim through a few chapters just to get through it. I am well aware this book is targeted towards teens, but as a young adult myself (22yrs) I was very unsatisfied with Bella's character development. I felt she was very selfish and self centered. 
(spoiler alert!!)   
She got everything she wanted and then some. She got Edward as well as keeping Jacob in her life despite the fact that it caused him pain (before he imprinted). She got immortality, she got to keep Charlie in her new life as well as a daughter she didn't even know she wanted. 
And when Jacob imprinted on Bella's daughter, I was totally lost. I will admit I was all for Team Jacob eventhough I knew he didn't have a chance. I felt Jacob was a strong character who deserved to imprint on someone his own age who would offer everything Bella couldn't without the constant reminder of rejection (eventhough apparently when you imprint, past loves lost mean nothing). I think Meyer is a great author and should definately continue writing in this genre, especially since we lost Anne Rice to more religious topics. But she should keep in mind that unexpected plot twists don't always equal a good book.

Folks, I read tons of reviews before buying Seagate FreeAgent Desk 1 TB USB 2.0 External Hard Drive. The price/performance ratio seemed just right. For the money I paid ($140), this device seemed to deliver the most bang for my bucks (in terms of customer satisfaction).
Initially, I was quite elated at the performance of the drive. But the drive started to make a loud clicking noise a few days after I had put the hard drive into operation and transferred some of my most precious information to this drive. This hard drive seems destined to fail and I'm getting ready to return it and try something else.
I'm beginning to realize that it's probably a big mistake to rely on customers' reviews to buy single external hard drives at this juncture, since regardless of the make or model a large number of these hard drives continue to go bad.  Some poeple have incredibly great experiences; while others don't find themselves very lucky. It's probably a good idea to buy them in pairs and make two copies of all our precious data. That way, we wouldn't find ourselves up**** creek and without a paddle after transfering a great deal of data into one of these drives and then loose them all in a heartbeat when the drives fail.
I think it's worth buying hard drives that allow the buyers to daisy-chain them into external stacks. That seems a very convenient way of having duplicate copies of valuable data.

I recieved this as a Christmas present from my husband. The FIRST time we tried it, it wouldn't work! My husband who is a born engineeer tried everything to get it to work; checked the dials, the plug, the plates and finally after playing with the cord got it to work- once. It was great when it worked but the second time we tried we experianced the same problem, only this time we could not get it to work at all! Needless to say we are returning it and doubt we will re-purchase it. I can't help but assume that if we got one that worked it will probably have a short life if used frequently. I was extremely disappointed. I desperately wanted this and getting a new in box unused defective griddler was such a bummer! (Although it was very sweet of my hubby to purchase this for me!)

I received this as a Christmas gift last month. I really liked it a lot. I didn't feel the need for something very expensive or complicated, and this really fit the bill. It had a good sound, and was easy to navigate. After maxing out the song capacity @ almost 400 songs, it suddenly stopped working last night. It will now only turn on &amp; off, with the message "finalizing update" on the screen forever. This is very upsetting to me, as I was very careful with it, keeping it in the plastic case &amp; in a ziploc bag in my purse. Also, now that I think of it, I started having a little trouble with it turning on &amp; off a couple of weeks ago. Sometimes, I would have to push the on button 2x for it to come on. Overall, I would not recommend this product to anyone, because it wasn't even worth the $20 my husband spent on it. I am very disappointed in this MP3 player. Now I have to save up for another one, when I was hoping this one would last me a while.

I bought this as a Black Friday special to replace a Linksys Wireless B router. I didn't need to but it was cheap so I did.
Pros: 
-Setup was very simple; much easier than the Linksys router. The CD walks any user through the process, regardless of that individual's IT expierience. 
-The signal is very strong; I can connect to this router with full strength from anywhere within my apartment (approximatley 800 sq. feet).
Cons:
-Singal constantly drops or locks up. I am often surfing and my laptop will disconnect; when I try to reconnect I am unable to do so. The router has to be restarted and for those of you who have done it you know it is a time-consuming process. The router, cable modem, and both computers have to be restarting. Takes all of 10 minutes. 
To me it just wasn't worth it. I am using my linksys router again and will probably do so until I NEED to replace it. When that happens, I will most likely go with another Linksys product as Linksys has never given me an issue.

While not the best design, the Petmate Fresh Flow Cat Fountain functions fairly well. The pump is also surprisingly quiet, even when it's partially clogged. Initially my cat liked it a lot, but over time it became nearly impossible to clean thoroughly, which did not make the cat happy. Several times I resorted to soaking it in a bleach solution, which was all I could do to make the cat use it again. The tight spaces with severe angles made it difficult at best to get a sponge in. Using the dishwasher didn't help much either. After a year I replaced the unit with a Hagen Catit Drinking Fountain which seems to be much easier to clean.
Pros: 
- Quite pump 
- Charcoal filter system
- Water ramp (which my cat loves) 
Cons: 
- Filter is after the pump making it easily clogged by fur 
- Must be cleaned weekly, if not more 
- Reservoir can not be quickly filled, and impossible to clean
- Hard to throughly clean by hand or in the dishwasher
- Potential for bacteria buildup.

I've used Final Draft for Macintosh since Version 5. It's always been a touch cranky but well worth the trouble. This is no longer the case with version 7.0 (and the upgrade to 7.0.0.33 seems to have made things worse). Cursor position is unstable, that is you probably aren't entering text where you think you are. Randomly, selected text refuses to unselect. Parentheticals won't allow you to move the cursor to the next block of dialog. Smart type "forgets" character names and locations, et cetera. As is, this program is unusable and repeated e-mails to the publisher have gone unanswered.I hope they fix the problems, until they do I've gone back to version 6, and I'm out the cost of the upgrade.

It's been a long time since I had to end a movie in less than a 1/2 hour of watching it.  In this case, I'm not sure if it even made it to 15 mins. The beginning scenes were so scattered that it was difficult to get a feel for the movie.  Then, is it supposed to be a drama, comedy, anyones guess. Appeared to be "Gone with the Wind" meets "Road Warrior". Awful!!

This is the British Version. I can't find the American version, which is narated by Sigourney Weaver, not some British guy, on Amazon. Otherwise I think the content is the same, but Sigourney is better. The American version is available on the discovery channel website.

although the movie visuals were cool, the writing lacked a lot.  there were also lots of scenes that were thrown together for laughs, that were just really, really STUPID!!  spend time with spidey, captain jack, or the silver surfer all are better choices.

My girlfriend and I have a spare DVD player that we were using before we moved as well as an LCD monitor. We wanted to hook both of them up in the bed room so that we could watch some DVDs. This product worked great for about three days (though it did over saturate the color a bit) and then it would start to flicker a little bit... then a lot... then it would loose color and only be in black and white. Then about two days later it went back to color for a few hours before it started flickering again. I returned this product and I'm going to try a different one (hasn't arrived yet)

I had the same straightener for about 4 years, and I loved it.  Since purchasing a new one from Amazon, I have not been impressed.  The quality is not near as good as my first one- in which I do not know why if they are the same.  The ends don't completely meet on one end and I think this is where the problem is.  Not sure if its the supplyer or just a bad one, but I am not impressed and regret the online purchase.  I should have gone to store to avoid this mishap.  But I do love the CHI straighteners.  Just not this one.

Small as advertised.  Can be confusing on which way to insert when being put in a USB drive (unlike most thumb drives, it will go into a drive either "right side up" or the opposite).  Not a big deal if you use only one or two computers, but computer manufacturers do not install their drives in only one direction across the brands.  The drive did come with a small rubber plastic case which would have been a great carry option if it wasn't pink...?
The primary reason I am writing this review is that I inserted the drive into a work computer today and "nada".  Same thing here at home.  Drive has stayed in my wallet, not run through a washer, etc.  Obviously unsatisfactory for a thumb drive (even generics are noteworthy for their reliability).  Perhaps, this is atypical for this manufacturer-or not-, but less than one month of light use rates the one star I am giving it.

This product does not displace the cat's desire to drink out of the kitchen faucet.  The unit makes enough noise to be distracting in a quiet room (not a "fountain" noise, but rather a "motor" noise.)  We used a large pyrex measuring cup to fill the fountain . . . the cat was more interested in drinking the remaining water out of the pyrex cup afterwards.  Clever idea, but I'd recommend against it.

Do not buy this for PS3 especially if you are looking for a wheel easily compatible with Gran Turismo.  It is not one of the indicated wheels and comes with PC installation instructions.  The controls are not corresponding to those in the options menu.  Sure, pedals aren't metal, you don't get a clutch pedal and the steering wheel isn't leather wrapped but the GT steering wheel is a better value for most gamers.

I've used this trimmer a few times and it pulls a lot. I have an old Connair el cheapo and it does the trick without pulling - the only concern is that I can smell burning when I use it which is why I got another one. I'll stick to scissors for now until I find a trimmer that works properly.
I had this product for about eight months before it died on me. When it was working it was quite painful to use, often pulling and tearing away the nose hairs. The light was absolutely pointless. It was better than the Connair I had prior to it whose motor you could smell burning as you used it. I can't believe how few choices there are for trimming nose hair and how useless they are.

Two years ago, like many users here I jumped over from Quicken on the PC to Quicken Mac... hoping that it would work as well. My wife and I loved the Mac but struggled with Quicken each week to reconcile our very simple checking and savings accounts from our credit union. We hoped that we would just get better at living with its quirks or that its quirks would get ironed out in updates. Neither ended up happening. 
I wouldn't say that we do ANY kind of advanced accounting at all. Very simple, straightforward downloading/matching of transactions, trying to monitor a budget, etc. I cannot imagine how we made it through nearly 2 years of using Quicken for Mac without going completely crazy!
We finally had enough when Quicken started LOSING transactions that were downloaded from our bank. One moment my paycheck would be there and downloaded, then we'd go look for it in the register... GONE. WTF?!? How does a program like this LOSE a transaction. It happened 3 times and that was it. I searched for new Mac finance software and thank goodness we found MoneyDance. I'd looked at it several months ago but it didn't really look all that great. But after actually buying it and using it we're totally hooked! It is SO much better than Quicken in SO many ways it's hard to address everything here. 
First there's the matching of transactions. To be honest, my real favorite finance software on the PC was Microsoft Money which imported online banking transactions more accurately with fewer false-matches than Quicken PC ever did. Still, it's hard to imagine ANY program that is more inept at guessing transaction matches than Quicken Mac. That's the first big problem.
MoneyDance excels at transaction matching. All fields auto-complete as if psychic. If you need to change something, it's very simple and intuitive and it remembers that change for the next time that type of transaction comes up. Advantage: MoneyDance
Second, there is no easy way to sort transactions by cleared/uncleared in Quicken. A completely ridiculous oversight. All I want to do is download my online transactions and update my own record comparing it to what the bank shows... then see a total of cleared vs. uncleared. In Quicken, uncleared transactions can only be viewed by running some complicated, customized report. Why not a simple column sorting capability? This is a no-brainer and MoneyDance allows sorting by any column - date, check number, payee, amount, CLEARED transactions. Advantage: MoneyDance. 
In fact, MoneyDance has a drop-down display with four $ amounts for your checkbook register: ledger (your true checkbook balance), cleared (what has cleared from the bank), bank's balance (what your bank actually showed as balance), and current balance (accounting for anything that is pending on the next business day). It works so well that we don't even have to 'balance' our accounts monthly any more. Our accounts are balanced each and every day when we download new transactions. We're able to verify easily all outstanding checks by simply sorting the register by what is cleared - which is so far ahead of Quicken it's just insane. To see your bank's balance in Quicken you have to go back into the Download transactions window.
Third, budgeting features on Quicken are hopelessly complex to setup. This shouldn't be so amazingly difficult. It's addition and subtraction. In MoneyDance you just setup your categories, make a new budget and add the items/amounts in the list. MoneyDance even has a bar graph at the top of your account view that shows where your budget income/expenses level is currently.
Fourth, overall software layout and interface. Quicken looks pretty at first until you start trying to use it. Any toolbar button you push opens another little window. Great if you have a huge monitor where you can spread all of them out but really useless on normal screens. MoneyDance mostly consolodates functions into one changing window. Advantage: MoneyDance.
Fifth, transaction searching. Hello Intuit, this is a Mac. It has something called 'Spotlight' search that's been around for several years now. MoneyDance has a spotlight-type search built right into the top of the register. Looking for a specific transaction? Just try typing it in the search bar and the as-you-type list populates with matching results. Crazy-easy. Advantage: MoneyDance.
So my recommendation is to take a look at MoneyDance and steer clear of Quicken Mac. No amount of refinement on the PC side has made it over to the Mac version. You will hate this program. It will cause you problems! 
Stay away!!!

I have the WRT 54g v8.  Router.  Every so often, it drops the connection.  It becomes useless until you reboot it.  I was surfing yesterday, using my Pocket PC.  Everything was fine.  I tried a couple of hours later and I got the message Invalid Key.  I went to my wired computer and I could not get online.  I used the Easylink advisor and it showed that it could not find the SSID or the key or anything.  So I had to reboot.  This has happened twice so far.  I did not spend as much time trouble shooting this time because I had seen it before.  It looks like it will stay up for about a week before I have to reboot.  I can live with it but I expected better.

The main problem witht this book is that she spends too much time on Bella's lameness. This book is seriously lacking the energy that books need to keep reader's reading, and despite the stuff with Jacob, it just doesn't grip at all. However, despite my bad review of Eclipse, Eclipse and Breaking Dawn are both 5times as good as this. So despite the fact that this book could be a struggle, the rest of the series makes it worth reading.

This review is from: Australia (DVD)
      
I was very disappointed with this film. Given the strong connection to Xavier Herbert's book "Poor Fellow My Country" (and hi earlier "Capricornia"), acknowledged near the end of the final credits, it would have been better to get a bit closer to either the facts or Herbert's stories. The beef baron was actually English, not Australian, and the kow-towing to the English was much greater in reality. The separation between whites and aborigines was far sharper and harsher than  portrayed, and remains so, albeit significantly lessened these days (I lived in Darwin for some years). The peer pressure to conform to the social norms was far greater than portrayed. When was there ever an aboriginal woman who couldn't swim, or at least float? And where are these big cliffs and deserts between Katherine and Darwin? Herbert also viewed the behavior of many people in Darwin at the time of the first  Japanese bombing as quite shameful, and the conclusion of "Poor Fellow My Country" was anything but upbeat: it was a tragedy, pure and simple. The courageous died or disappeared, and the drones and the mindless mob inherited the Earth.
So, watch "Australia" for the scenery, for the cinematography, for some false nostalgia, a spot of romance, and some feel-good stuff, but don't mistake it for any kind of reality, past or present.

Just received the Vado HD.
Pros:
Small camcorders in theory are fun and allow you to take video where you normally would not - big kudos to the convenience factor.
Buttons are well placed.
Large memory size - but in reality you don't need it because when using these cameras you take small clips and then download.  But if you do record all on one shot this may be a bigger pro for you.
Actual videos are nice for such a small camera on the TV but not as nice as the HD TV picture quality you may be used to.
Battery life seems very good and you can replace them when they eventually die out.
Cons:
Video can be very shaky if you are not ever so careful - so they lack of image stabilization is a problem if you are careful.
Optical zoom is lacking and using the digital zoom is a huge mistake as the picture becomes very pixelated.
Low lighting situations are very pixelated/grainy
The USB jack located on the bottom is a poor location especially for placing this on something flat so it can record.
BIGGEST complaint is the software and MAC issues.  You can get it to work but you must download additional codecs and such and convert - just ugly and not very easy. I finally did figure it out with the help of a savvy computer geek and then the additional conversion seem to take an even bigger hit on the video quality. It was jerky on playback - and this was on the latest brand new mac. The software interface and ease of sending to videos to family via email - it was just not a click and go camcorder like I had hoped given all of the conversion steps.  I will be returning this  and probably buy into the MinoHD cult which I know is easy to use and has equally good video quality or maybe the Kodiak Zi6 which has come down significantly in price.

As part of installing a network in the house with both wired and wireless machines, I contracted a local vendor to setup this wireless router.  After three failed attempts to make it work we switched to a competitors brand and had no problems.  In the wired mode the router was fine, but the wireless was a disaster.  Not only did the router not work, but the software that comes bundled with it crashed two XP computers on the network (leaving a Win 2000 system untouched -- go figure).  This router caused me several hours of headaches and the technicians even more.  If I could give it a zero, I would.

We purchased this for our three cats, set to dispense 3/4 of a cup 3 times a day.  After watching it dispense, we discovered it dispenses the wrong amount.  The 1/4 cup setting dispenses a little more than 1/4 cup, the 1/2 cup setting dispenses nearly 1 cup, and 3/4 cup setting dispenses over 1.5 cups.  It's possible that this is because our cat food is pellets that are pretty small, but either way - if you buy this, be sure to check to see how much it's *actually* dispensing!

This grinder worked very well, for the year or so it worked.  The only complaint I would have is the static electricity imparted to the coffee, the device, or both, which made the process alittle messy.  That may simply be an affliction that all such devices have.  All this said, it seems to me that the clear plastic canister on the top, and particularly the integrated tabs that fit into the grinder itself, were flimsy.  That is how the machine got busted.  Past its warranty.  Given that the other reviewers, many of them, describe this as one of the hardiest of the grinders in its class, I am not sure about what to buy as a replacement,

The quality of this swaddle blanket is very good, I'm not complaining about that. The problem we've had with our newborn is that as he squirms the blanket rides up and hits his cheeks.  This triggers his newborn rooting instinct, which makes him search around frantically for a nipple to suck on. Instead of lulling him to sleep it gets him frantic with hunger.

I regret not following the advice of the majority of reviewers on this one. These really are terrible sheets. I have the Graco Cubby Parade Pack N Play and figured the sheets would be good since they're manufactured by the same company. Boy was I wrong. They don't fit the pad very well regardless if it's laying flat for the playpen or if it's set up for the bassinet. Since the bassinet is 3/4 the pad folds up and the sheet doesn't stay put very well at all. They are also cheaply made. Thin isn't even the word. It's upsetting that my Babies r Us only carries this brand. I'm going to return the rest for a store credit and try to find a suitable replacement elsewhere. As for now I am currently using my bassinet w/o a sheet. The pad wipes down well and if i'm going to have my daughter in there for a long time I use a waterproof pad under her. Since she's always wrapped in a blanket she doesn't mind going w/o the sheet.

We are studying the Civil War in my sophomore American History class, and everybody must read a book about the Civil War, so i took on the challenge of reading GWTW. Wow. What an amazing book. No other book can make you love and hate a character at the exact same time. It will be hard to enjoy other books when you compare them to GWTW. So, after reading it i just HAD to watch the movie. I couldn't even finish it. It left out a lot from the book, and you didn't get to know the characters as well. I do realize that it was made in the late thirties, and that it would take hours and a narrator to include everything in the book, but it was still a disappointment. But if you liked the movie, you MUST read the book. Don't be scared by the size! And the first four hundred pages worth of actionless descriptions are necessary in order to lay a good foundation for the greatest story ever told. &lt;- and that is an understatement!!! Please read this book! You will never be the same!

I wish I could give this junk 0 stars.  Why is this even in the religious section of this website?!  This blasphemous movie is an offense to all people of faith and to God himself.  It seems Bill Maher and those like him won't be happy until America is seduced into the giving away of all the beliefs and freedoms that have made her great.  They won't rest until the worshipers of God and their teachings are silenced and everyone believes in what Bill does.  Don't be fooled, Bill does indeed have a dogmatic, violent and absolute religion and it's called atheism (albeit with a halo of existentialism).  It seems Mr. Maher has decided to become a contributor to the destruction of our peacefuly coexistent society, pity.  As a libertarian, I do support Bill's right to say whatever he wants, as I will not hold a double standard. But I feel athiests will nevertheless always abuse their freedom in advancing their intolerant beleifs.  Tell me when atheism was a force for good in the world?  When has it produced anything more than the devaluation of human life and rights?  If there is no God, where do we even get our "rights" from?  We are all just monkeys in their eyes, worthless people with worthless dreams.  But we who believe in God know that we are not just people, we all count, and we do have rights and one of those is to worship our maker.  We are the intelligent ones, we can order our own lives well, and show a gentleness atheism can only briefly imitate.  Only a fool says in his heart, "There is no god." Bill Maher is a foolish, foolish man, and doesn't know what he's talking about.

Rather than lose the data I had stored I opened the case, removed the drive and installed it in my desktop machine - works great now as a 1TB second drive.

The mechanical design is somehow flawed.  I expected the yoke to slide back and forward with ease and return to center when released.  The movement should be on ball bearings for the price of the product. Instead, the yoke return position (controlled by springs, I am guessing) stopped anywhere in a +/- 0.5 inch location. The simulators I use react to this movement and I am constantly correcting. Maybe I some how received a product that slipped through QC.  I am dissappointed.  I could design one better than the one I purchased and cannot recommend this product.

I have had one of these for about 3 years now.  I wish I had never bought it.  Condensation builds up inside the water compartment which also holds the covered grinder bin.  If you don't open the top after you finish the coffee, moisture builds up inside the grinder and the coffee begins to get wet as it is ground.  This ends up jamming the grate where the coffee is pushed into the filter.  
I had another brand of grinder/brewer for years.  It had a separate compartment for grinding and for storing the water.  This one is a big hassle.  Lot's of cleaning/drying just to get it to work right.  We just grind the coffee in a separate grinder now to avoid the hassle of opening and wiping the grinder out all the time.  
Cuisinart chose form over function for this machine and I am surprised that it is still on the market.  It has kept me from buying other Cuisinart machines.  
My wife and I both dislike this machine very much.  It is too expensive to be so poorly designed.  I did not buy it to spend my time after making coffee cleaning out the steamy mess from the grinder.

I bought this unit since there seemed to be a fair amount of pod coffees available for it.  I bought about 6 different brands in addition to the Senseo brand to see which I liked the best, etc.  Wow, did I make a mistake.  Unless you want to stick exclusively with Senseo coffees, you should not get this unit.  Most of the other makes of coffee pods are the wrong diameter or too thick for the single-pod insert while being too thin for the double-pod insert.  And most of them can't be double-stacked in the double-pod holder.  Apparently this unit forms a pressure seal, so if the thickness or the diameter of the pod is off you won't get a decent cup of coffee, or the machine won't seal, or if it does it will only partially seal and you'll get a nice spray of hot water all over.  I'll probably throw this unit up for sale on an auction site once I've run through the coffee I have.  I will then switch to Keurig.  In its defense it does make a good cup of Senseo coffee, but I want more than 4 or 5 types of coffees to choose from.

This review is from: Transformers (Two-Disc Special Edition) (DVD)
      
Yeah, yeah, it's Transformers, what do you expect? I expect it not to suck!
Whatever. 
The reason I purchased this film, yes I purchased it, was to show off my home theater. It's a reference disc, no doubt about that. The picture quality is outstanding, and so is the sound. Especially the SOUND!
The story blew, the acting was godawful, and the whole Sector 7 bit was atrocious. This goes down as one of the worst movies of the year. Funny how this makes a ton of money, and great double feature films like Grindhouse make nothing.
The film is long, and I would say only 30 solid minutes are devoted to the action-considering the film is almost 2 1/2 hours. I pretty much had my finger on the FF button.
It's only in my collection, because it's a reference disc of the highest caliber.

This review is from: The Princess Bride (DVD)
      
This is one of the most enjoyable movies I can remember watching while growing up.  The only problem with it is the annoying cut scenes that feature Fred Savage being read the story.  Had Reiner simply provided the story as is, without the annoying backdrop of a sick kid being read the story in bed, it would have ben perfect.  It has everything you could want in a classic adventure.That being said, if you haven't been duped into buying this DVD yet, take my advice, and stay away. My rating reflects the DVD, and not the film, which I would give 5 stars.  Buy the Special Edition instead of this.  This DVD is the worst one I own.  The "Special Features" that are loaded on  this puppy include a trailer and...well that's it. The "collectible booklet" is the DVD insert that all DVDs have with the word "collectible" thrown in.  They could call the plastic wrap on it "collectible" too for all it's worth.  For a DVD to come out in 2000, especially for a film this good, and have jck for extras, is an atrocity.  They obviously rushed it out so they could sell the Special Edition later.However, my biggest problem with this DVD is that it IS NOT TRUE WIDESCREEN!  The only thing that makes it widescreen is that the picture is technically wider than it is high.  They did this by actually taking the full screen version, and chopping off the top and bottom, instead of showing it in the true 16:9 aspect ratio it was shot in.  People buy widescreen format to see the true film, since full screen cuts off part of the movie.  This is the reverse in this case.  If you watch the full screen version, you actually see considerably more of the film than the widescreen.  THAT is the reason to stay way from this horrible disc.  Although if you're REALLY cheap and only watch movies in Full Screen, go ahead and get this version.

I bought this because ConsumerSearch said that Seagate made the best-reviewed external HDs. Unfortunately, after 2 weeks of working OK, I suddenly started getting "delayed write failure" and $Mft errors. Those are very bad signs. I had already saved over 50GB worth of data on there, representing 2 weeks of tedious work. After hours of troubleshooting, I noticed that my data was accessible for a few minutes right after restarting the unit, so I spent all night repeatedly restarting the unit by pulling the power cord out and reinserting it, copying as much data as I could before it failed on me again, repeat over and over again. What a nightmare. When the auto shutoff feature was acting buggy from the beginning, I should have been wary. I'm going back to Buffalo. I have a Buffalo HD that's worked perfectly for 3 yrs, despite my having dropped it on the ground and damaging the case.

1st loaf was ok but machine began malfunctioning on second loaf.  Return to manufacturer was easy but replacement is on back order for 3 months now even though you can still buy it in stock off Salton's website.   Customer service has nothing but backorder excuses.   I was even told at 2 months that it hasn't been that long (hinting I was complaining for nothing).
My biggest mistake was not returning to amazon (I was at 30 day mark and called the manufacturer).
1 star for poor manufacturer response.
Update....by coincidence I received shipping confirmation the same day I typed the review.   Hopefully the machine works well this time.

I first saw this kettle at a friend's apartment, and was entirely wooed by the beautiful design.  As someone who drinks tea night and day, and is fussy about design and quality, I insisted on having it.  For the first few months I was ecstatic - great ease of use, stayed looking good, no stink like others have mentioned, and I loved the lighted meter - but then one morning it mysteriously died.  Totally dead.  No power outage, no problem with my surge protector, no fried circuts - just dead.  This is a pricey appliance from a good company but I had bad luck - what a bummer.

After a parade of 2 Linksys and 2 D-Link routers dying on me, I decided to try a Netgear.
Auto setup worked well, and I was able to get connected.  Wow, maybe this time it would be different!
Nope... I connected at 54 mbps and within 30 seconds it was down to 1 mbps.  Yup, that's right, 1 mbps.  I tried reseting everything, but to no avail.  It never came back up past 18 mbps, arrrrrgggghhhh...
Now, you may be thinking it's a cable modem problem.  Nope, the connection flies when hooked directly to the modem.  I wish you all good luck when searching for a consumer wireless router.

This software is significantly slower than Office 2004, despite that 2004 ran under Rosetta, and this one is Universal.  There are a number of bugs (try dragging a chart in Excel, it will likely disappear... was there in 2004 also).  Even after the first service pack/update, it is still garbage.  Entourage is still as bad as it was in 2004, if not worse.  Word is so slow, that an person of average typing speed can type a few sentences before it actually shows up on the screen (or an entire paragraph if you have Parallels running).  There are few new features, most of this is interface change.  They also removed macros, which won't affect the vast majority of users.  They should have added a Formula Review button/screen as they've had in Excel 2003 for PC (it may have existed earlier).  They should have also tested it to see how slow it would go (which maybe they did - make Office as painfully slow as possible to try to get Mac owners to buy PCs just to get fast Office).
This "upgrade" follows the Vista pattern - Office 2004 was better.
A better choice would be to buy Parallels, XP Pro, and Office 2003 or iWork, or something - anything - else.  Heck, even Office 2004 is better.

This HD requires windows or mac to set up the HD for usage by the LaCie installer.

When our coffemaker died of old age and overuse, my wife wanted a programmable coffeemaker. She drinks decaf; I drink high test. Her pot could be ready at 5:30, she could pour it in an insulated carafe and (God bless her) make my pot.
Though it makes good coffee, I kind of hate this machine. I'd like to slap its designers.
For years I have had a succession of wonderfully designed, inexpensive Braun Aromaster pots that make great coffee. This Cuisinart thing pales in comparison. When you open the top, condensate drips on the stove or countertop. The carafe, rather than having a hinged lid, has a hard-to-remove-and-reinstall snap-on job. The reservoir is really hard to pour water into, especially if your machine is under a vent hood or overhanging cabinet.
What idiot designed this thing?
When it dies, I'm going to be Braun again.

I loved the first 3 parts and could not go to bed before not having finished them. This book was the only one I read in 2 days - and I could have taken a break even more often. 
I agree with other reviews that the message this last book sends is wrong: marry with 18 and live happily with your perfect partner and your perfect child. The perfectness of the main characters was increasingly getting on my nerves. After hearing it a 1000 times I knew how beautiful Edward was - no need to mention it 1001 times. In the other books this Bella-adoring-Edward and vice versa-thing seemed not as bad as Bella had her (human) flaws. 
What no one has mentioned by now: Wasn't Bella getting on your nerves by feeling guilty for everything that went wrong in her surroundings? She is constantly feeling responsible and sorry even though sometimes there is no need for her to be.  
Well, with one exception: The only time Bella could and should have been really sorry, she isn't: when she endangers her life (and thus Edward's life) by continuing her pregnancy. By her knowing the story of the immortal children and her not-knowing what exactly was growing in her body she also endangered her new beloved family. Weird: she felt horrible and excused herself 100times when she cut her finger, Jasper attacked her, and she thought she caused the family problems. 
Ok, I admit one might say, the love for her baby is so strong that she does not care that her Edward is almost dying due to grief, that the Cullens are separated into a pro- and anti-baby faction, etc. But then again: wasn't Edward the biggest love of her life? After the baby comes into the story, Edward's character seems to disappear. 
All in all, I was very disappointed of the plot and the characters. DB ruined the saga for me.

I upgraded from a Linksys firewall and Apple Airport to this unit and was delighted with the great price, wireless range, and configurable features (although there is no way to log attempted intrusions).   But once I fired up iChat and tried to video chat I was defeated by this router, which simply refuses to let video or audio chat work, and Netgear even acknowledge there is a problem with this at their support pages.   This had worked perfectly through the Linksys.   Then, as I worked further with the router, I discovered that the wireless connection is spotty - dropping maybe twice an hour for a few seconds at a time.   Again, this seems to be something many compain of.Overall, it seems wonderful, but has ultimately let me down.   I am looking for a new router.

Three hours into it and I stopped being able to think clearly.  Using this with Windows is likely the culprit, along with the ridiculous setup instructions included in the box.   Online support at apple.com equally unhelpful.  I'm giving it another try tomorrow, with S.Monroe's instructions (above) here on Amazon.  I observed an Airport Express being installed from an iMac over the holidays and figured "I can do that."  Au contraire:  While it may ultimately work, it's been fruitless effort so far trying to install it with Windows.

I bought this and it does not work. I plugged it in and nothing happened.  I tried their trouble shooting tricks and still nothing happened.  Of course, I thought I'd made a mistake, so I went through the procedure again.  Still nothing.  I got a message that said the disk drive could not be fragmented.  Ok, so now I am packing this device back up and sending it on it's way.  I'll spend my money on something that works.

This review is from: Australia (DVD)
      
We couldn't decide if this movie was supposed to be a comedy or serious.  It may have been one of, if not THE, worst movie of 2008!  The only reason for one star is Hugh Jackman, who even in a corny thing like this can come across as someone watchable.  And what is with Nicole Kidman and those pumped up lips - it seemd to affect her performance.
People, don't bother with this movie!

I have a brand new iMac with an AirPort Extreme card installed.  I finally got around to purchasing this wireless router to go with it.  I have been using the non-wireless 614 router with no problems and figured moving to the wireless version of the same product would be a piece of cake.  Well, it wasn't exactly plug-and-play.
First off, I'm a software engineer.  Tinkered with the hardware side a bit as well.  Have been Unix sys admin before.  I'm no dummy.  As a _wired_ router, I've had no problems with this unit.  Wireless, on the other hand, hasn't been so great.  I would say that, very reliably, my wireless iMac can detect the presence of the router.  But trying to connect to it hasn't worked very well.  Once I enabled the AirPort card in the iMac, I was able to detect other wireless transceivers in the building and surf the net on their ISP's.  (There's one called 'linksys' that's always worked.)  I could also detect my own NETGEAR router, but the connection would fail.  Usually.  This is the second time (I've only had it 24 hrs but have played with it almost constantly) that I've made a connection with my router.  I've done all kinds of resets and playing with configs, moving the components into different rooms, and honestly, nothing happened between my last failure to connect and now.  I mean, it is capable of working, but my neighbors' wireless routers have been more reliable than the one I bought for myself.
1.5 stars.

This review is from: Howard the Duck (VHS Tape)
      
what everyone seems to forget is that "howard the duck" was a comic book made by marvel in the late 70s. this wasn't some cutesy harvey comics deal. it wasn't dark, but it wasn't a part of the regular marvel universe --- per se. actually, howard did make his first appearance in a man-thing comic ("adventure into fear"?) and would eventually wind up in a "marvel team-up" (#95?) with good old spider-man. so what i'm trying to say is that george lucas had no idea what he was doing (where was dr. bong?), and that's why the movie sucked. in the comics, beverly is a voluptuous redhead, and okay, lea thomson is hot, but she was totally wrong for the role.speaking of roles, everyone mentions jeffrey jones and tim robbins, but no one mentions thomas dolby as the bartender.the same thing happened with "teenage mutant ninja turtles", the filmmakers totally made them 'cute', and those films stunk as well, but at least they made money. why they made money, i'll never know... nor would i want to. the comics were dark, and once the first movie came out, i sold the comics. didn't want to be associated with that crowd (and the comics weren't that great anyway).bottom line: i'm still waiting for the forbush man movie. you know it. oh wait, that was "blankman", wasn't it?

It feels to me like this was just a bunch of ideas of HOW to end the series shoved into one long, not very entertaining book.  I found myself very bored throughout most of the book.  There was no great conflict, no great adventure, and no great love like the previous books had.  
I know not all books need a message, but I adored the first three books and the message of love &amp; sacrifice.  I cried for Bella's sacrifice at the end of Eclipse and for Jacob's too. In the end, he did let go of Bella even though he loved her with his entire being. It was so beautifully sad and romantic. I really connected to the characters and felt their pain.  In this book, I didn't feel a thing.  I found myself irritated and bored almost the entire time.  If it had been any other book, I would have stopped reading, but I wanted to this book to be good so badly that I kept on going until the very end.
This review is pretty pitiful, I know, but really - I'm just speechless at how BAD this book was.  There are some really well written reviews on here that articulate the issues so much better than I have.  I just had to add my poorly worded two cents to the collection.
Boo, Stephenie.  Next time, don't let your editors &amp; fans rush you to finish something until you &amp; your characters are ready.

This software is not worth the money you pay for it.  It has a ridiculous and time consuming installation process which doesn't work on some systems and they do not bother to tell you this in advance.  The company is unreliable and difficult to communicate with.  They have now twice promised me update CDs to correct the problems with their software which have not arrived (the first time they promised me was about 8 months ago and the last being over 2 months ago.)  Not all the features that are supposed to come with this software actually work. 
There are other programs for screenwriters out there.  Save yourself the money, the time and the headache - try a different one.

I wanted to love this product.  I've been through two of them already, and they have both died on me within days of my having received them.  In both cases, the same problem occurred:  The battery refuses to charge.  Plug it into a USB port, a powered USB hub, or anything else, and I get the same result.  The thing just won't accept any juice, will not mount on either a Mac or a PC, and is otherwise useless.
Tried contacting tech support at Flip/Pure Digital--good luck to you if you ever have a problem.  They have no phone support, just automated email responses, in which they give you the same instructions already available in the user manual, or on their web site.
I'm sending both of mine back to Amazon for a refund.  I guess I'm going to look around for another pocket camcorder.

I bought ACT 2009 based on an exec's past experience with an old old version of ACT. We'll see how the venerable franchise has held up over the years.
During installation, a "Prereq" program that runs in the background throws 2 exceptions, so right off the bat, I think the installation is possibly corrupted.
I let the installation finalize, I launch the program, even with a fresh install, the software takes a long time to launch. This does not bode well for future performance at all.
Ok then, I trudge through this to see if there's anything redeeming.  obviously the first order of business is to create a new database: I tried to do it but got an error "Unable to create the database. There is an error connecting to the Microsoft SQL Server".
At this point, I think I would just return the software and look for some other alternative. I am sure there's other companies that have more experience in creating software that's not so buggy.

This review is from: Pinocchio (Disney Gold Classic Collection) (DVD)
      
That's right, you heard me!  I hate this movie!  I used to give it two stars, or maybe even three, but over time it just got worse to me.One of the many misunderstandings about this film is that it is a kids' movie....when I was a little kid, I found it quite scary, depressing, and even disturbing (the scene where the boy turns into a donkey still sends shivers up my spine).However. . . . . . Jiminy Cricket should've won an Oscar!  He is the true heart and soul of the film.  He is very, very funny!!! Some might say that Pinocchio is the best.  But he comes off as an idiotic little brat/punk.  And supporting Oscar to Cleo the cat!  He's awesome!  I hate the goldfish, however!All those who say this is one of Disney's best:  BAH HUMBUG!

I used this juicer for the first time this morning, and initially was really excited about it.  It seemed to work well, and was quick!  After I used it, I immediately cleaned and rinsed the parts and washed everything in the dishwasher.  Maybe 3-4 hours later I took everything out of the dishwasher to make a new batch of juice.  I found that all along the seams of the mesh filter basket little pieces of carrot had collected.  So I tried cleaning the seams again with the brush that comes with it, I tried soaking it, I tried soaking it in a lemon juice solution as suggested by the owners manual, I tried vinegar, and regular soap and water.  I finally even tried a toothbrush, but there was still carrot stuck in the seams of the filter.
This seems to be a very serious design flaw, as this could easily make someone sick.  I can just imagine how bad this would get over the course of a few months or years.  Needless to say, I did not use the juicer again, and unfortunately had to abandon my juice fast that I started today.  I was extremely disappointed!
As the manufacturer is not open today, I was unable to reach them.  But I am hoping at the very least that they have a replacement filter without the seams.  If they do not, I plan to return this immediately.

This review is from: Transformers (DVD)
      
Got it for my son as an early Christmas gift. When we put it in the DVD player the words came up "Transformers_Vanilla". I could guess what this meant and wasn't happy. My son was looking forward to watching some "special features" or "behind the scenes" footage that typically come with a DVD. But there was none. It appears that this version doesn't come with that. You have to pay extra and buy the "Special two-disk version". He is very disappointed and I am very angry with Amazon that there was no warning on their web page. Not that I would have been happy about paying more for some footage that normally comes on a DVD....I also understand that manufacturers are doing this more often these days. It doesn't make it right...

I'll quickly go through a list of why this show is not good for a casual, or even hard-core sci-fi fan.
1. camera angles.  The cameraman is in a constant seizure while taking every shot.  Some call it edgy or dedication, I call it crap.  During spacebattles they zoom in and out, IN and out, IIN and out, then you barf and ships explode offscreen and then the battle's over.
2. Plot.  If you wanted Lord of the Rings of Sci-fis, this is definitely not it.  There's enough holes in the script, I'm suprised the actors can read it.  Every episode, the writers just pull something out of their butt and say: we've planned this since the beginning, to impregnate a robot.  wtf?
3. Mood.  If you love Colonel O'Neill on Stargate SG-1 and all his funny quips...go watch SG1, because this dialogue is devoid of comedy.  People say: It's supposed to be dramatic and serious.  That's bull.  Anyone who's been in a real life stressful situation ESPECIALLY WAR (ask your grandparents) tell jokes out of nervousness and desperation all the time.  Personally, these colonials can stay the hell away from Earth, cause I don't want their unemotional selves near me.
4. Music. Where is it?  All I hear is a constant low, changing tone in the background.  Even bad movies and shows are saved by a good orchestra every now and then.
5. Special Effects. These are actually pretty good.  I think the space battles "would" look nice if the zoom function was broken on the computer model camera for once.
6. Technology.  Basically: We're lookin at an advanced race of humans with laser guns in their fighters...then a virus takes out all the cool stuff and they're stuck with machine guns.  Yeah, I know, WWII in space.
7. Politics.  Now this angers me most of all.  That the show even focuses on this aspect just makes me want to lash out and destroy my TV.  The Secretary of Education takes over the presidency and instead of heeding the Admiral's advice or at least DOING WHAT'S SMART, she does stupid, moralistic crap to protect her own butt, even when she's dying from cancer.  If this happened to any nation on Earth, we'd immediately go to martial law which would supercede a political figurehead or democratic body.  I think 12 planets being wiped out and your entire race genocided constitutes a "national emergency".  And one last thing: Starbuck is a loser, end of story.
If you like Desperate Housewives or the West Wing, this is for you, but if you're a trekkie, a star wars fan, or any other person that enjoys good ol' fashioned sci fi: cover your eyes and hope it gets cancelled next year.

it's extremely unrecommended to order these units (wrt54g version 5), very bad firmware quality inside, no options to upgrade firmware (don't expect any new version soon), no chances to get bugs fixed.
device is very limited in memory, so no new features or functionality in the future planned.
frequently signal loses, bad compatibility with new MacBooks, frequent failure on routing requests and bugs in user interface (well known port forwarding bug still not fixed).
it's another great failure of well known proprietary solution called VxWorks
stay on open software, where lot's of enthusiasts reverifying ugly pices of code written by "very busy" people.
order wrt54gl instead ('L' means, it's running on linux, and could be easily upgraded to more stable open firmware in replacement of original default junk stored inside).

If you have old (3 or 4 years old connection) done with DSL modem of SpeedStream 4100 you may have problems with Linksys.

The device is nicely designed though so that it lats the 90 days and then you are stuck with a piece of junk.

I returned this camera today as I was very disappointed with the video quality.  The picture was grainy even filmed in the highest setting in bright light.  Even tried the mini HDMI with no success.  I believe that this is related to the compression used in AVCHD.  I would recommend sticking with tape despite its lack of glamor.  Tape has better quality video and is easier to edit.  The Canon HV20 or HV30 is the way to go.  By the way, if bought at a SonyStyle store they will charge you 15% restocking fee($150) -- if that's any indication to you of my disappointment.

The second time I used this blender, while I had my hand over the lid as I was pureeing fruit, the plastic cap in the center of the lid fell through the lid and was pulverized by the blades. Based on the other reviews, the blender probably works very well, but I would consider another blender with a more soundly constructed lid.

I have had this product about 6 months running on USB 2.0 with no problems. I recently bought a brand new PC with eSATA connections, a high quality eSATA cable and the problems began. 
With the eSATA cable I have found the drive extremely susceptible to having its file system corrupted when the PC is restarted. This has happened twice, once causing 14GB of important data to be converted to .CHK files which I spent a week sorting out.
I then had massive problems whereby the MyBook could not be reformatted under the eSATA connection. It would only work on USB 2.0.
Having emailed Western Digital they told me that the likely cause is that the eSATA controller in my new PC probably isn't one which has been officially tested to work. They have only tested it with 3 manufacturers on the planet however which is absolutely comedy.
I am now sticking with USB 2.0 but my faith in this drive has disappeared and I am scared about putting any important information on here.
Use eSATA with Western Digital drives at your peril, its like driving your car down the highway with your eyes closed.

I wouldn't recommend this software. It freezes and skips screens.  Plus the customer support web page is sorely lacking.  It's more of a marketing forum for you to hire one of their people to prepare your forms for you.  It's definitely not geared to the DIY crowd like Turbo Tax. Their on-line chat support is quite dismal.  At least the person I "chatted" on-line with was uninformed and blatantly nonresponsive for long stretches of time. Finally he agreed to have someone in a so called higher department contact me in a few days!  Not exactly a speedy response time.

I was excited to own the Kitchen Aid Artisan Mixer. Several of my friends own this Kitchen Aid Mixer. Also, many of the Food Network cooks use this mixer. I used the mixer a few times the first year after I purchased it.  
Due to an unfortunate situation, I didn't bake or use my Kitchen Aid Mixer from Feb. 2007 until Feb. 2008. The mixer sat idle. When I tried to use it this year, the motor would only work on high settings and then for only a few seconds. I contacted Kitchen Aid and they reminded me that my warranty is over. I explained the mixer was hardly used. It seems like I really got a bad product. Kitchen Aid states that they stand behind their products. They didn't do well with this one. I wish I hadn't thrown away my very old mixer of 30 plus years, made by another manufacturer. It still worked.

Trust me do not buy this player if u plan to watch movies every review ive read said audio and video goes out and everytime u email them they give u different people so they keep telling u to do the same thing over and over horrible support ( i know a few people who have recently bought this and they all have had the same problem), I purchased this for videos and audio. The video player was a horrible experience for me. the video converter that came with the player took hours to convert, and when it finally converted when i would fast-forward the audio would start about 5 seconds to early while the video was still loading. i have tried converting into all forms xvid dvix5/6 wmv avi no matter what i did at the resolution suggested and 30 fps it would go out of sync. at first i didnt mind because the audio only goes out of sync if u fast forward but then if u use the resume play capability it will go out of sync also. this made the video player useless because if u dont watch the movie all at once  it would be impossible to resume where you last left off.
the audio was just ok but i noticed that some songs regardless of 128kbps or 320kbps rips there would be crackling sounds in the back (for some songs) the screen gets scratched pretty easily and the whole front of the player gets filled with finger prints. i actually lost this player recently and im not to mad because now i can buy a new better player. maybe the creative vision w , or iriver, or sansa view, i would suggest to look at other players and use you tube to figure out which player is for you

Once we get past the lengthy travelogue and setup, the remainder of the movie is a snap to predict.  In fact, it is a wide screen, color version of a 1930s western.
A hoity toity English lady (Nicole Kidman) goes to Australia in 1938 to dispose of a cattle station (ranch) that is not profitable.  She meets a scruffy cattle drover (Hugh Jackman) and discovers that her husband has just died at the rundown station. And, oh, there's a cute, ragged, intelligent Aborigine boy who loses his mother.  Soon they all set out with a herd of cattle to sell at the port to save the station from an unscrupulous rival rancher.  I suspect that most anyone can write the rest of what happens.
Kidman looks aristocratic, then sweaty.  Jackman looks sweaty, then shaven and presentable.  They recite their lines without much interest, but that's OK, because the lines aren't very interesting.  The only thing worthwhile is the scenery of a barren outback that doesn't look as if it could support one cow, much less a herd.
Avoid this one.  See it only if you must.

This review is from: The Princess Bride (DVD)
      
By which I mean that Mr. Reiner, at this stage of his career, was still somewhat naive enough to think he was blazing a new trail with this material.  But tongue-in-cheek swashbucklers have been around since the Silent Era, and a serious movie-buff will not see anything that hasn't been done better before.  (*Raiders Of The Lost Ark*  made earlier in the decade is just for starters.)  The fact that the movie seems pitched to adults as much as to children doesn't absolve it from unoriginality . . . and in any case, rest assured that there's nothing TOO  "grown-up"  going here, nothing that would really fly over the kids'  heads, at any rate.  The immaturity also shows in the directing style, which was doubtless formed from the director's situation-comedy background:  stagey sets, relentless close-ups, so forth.  Even worse, Reiner insists on framing the story with a modern-day Grandpaw, READING the story to his grandson who's in bed with a cold  (another device straight from TV-Land -- bet on it, Grandpaw will eventually smile, turn out the light, and close the door).  There are several problems, here:  first, Peter Falk's makeup  (why didn't Reiner just hire an older actor?); second, he's reading to the kid what we're already witnessing; third, the story keeps getting interrupted by the sudden shifts away from the fantasy world and back to the prosaic modern day  (very annoying -- halfway through, one starts sitting on the edge of his seat, waiting for the next interruption.  Not the way to tell a story).  Oh . . . and  "don't get me stahted"  on Billy Crystal's  "comic"  cameo. . . .Okay, so I'm being a little harsh.  I just felt that, considering the almost hysterical partiality some have for this  "cult"  classic, a correction was long overdue.

Well... I'll just say that I have had better experiences with new computers. I like the form factor and the cool yellow color but Ubuntu is simply a pain in the neck. I can understand that some Linux enthusists might like twiddling with Ubuntu, but I don't. I sent it back and ordered something else. The camera was flaky and wireless is a hassle on any variant of Linux. When I buy a new computer, I want something that works out of the box, not a science project.

I was looking forward to this newest version. As soon as it finished loading, I started in to get some work done in Word and Excel. Little did I know there was a nasty shock waiting for me! What was this cartoon-like gibberish all over the screen? Where were the menu bars? Icons! Icons! Everywhere icons! All I could think was I had accidentally received the Student Edition for Pre-schoolers.
It is a nightmare to navigate. If you scroll over one of the cartoon icons; you get a pull-down menu that makes a Rubik's Cube look easy. I think MS forgot the most important rule of all - K.I.S.S.
I have used Excel and Word almost every day for the last ten years. Like others who have commented on this new version, I make my own menu/tool bars and can navigate through the programs with no problems. There are always a few adjustments when a newer version arrives which is fine. But this? Forget it! 
I have removed 2007 and reloaded 2003. Back to the drawing board on this one Microsoft! Dump the cutesy and give us streamlined, neat, usable programs.

We've had this coffee maker for a little over a year now and I thought it necessary to write a follow up review. For the first year or so this coffee pot was great. It brewed consistently good coffee and kept it warm (not hot) in the insulated carafe as promised. 
However after a year of use the coffee pot is really sluggish when brewing and automatically shuts off in 15 minutes. So unless you watch to be sure it is actually done brewing you will only be helping yourself to a cup or two rather than a whole pot of coffee. This is REALLY annoying. I have cleaned the machine many times running h20 and vinegar through but this has had no effect. It is like the machine strains to pump the water through. Also, because of this you can not be in a hurry to brew your coffee because it could take at least 20 minutes or more to brew a full pot. 
For a coffee maker with this price tag I would certainly expect more than a year of service out of it. Too bad. 
Because of this I would no longer recommend this coffee maker.

I am an engineer and fairly handy with mechanical items. The first one of these I bought started to leak when it brewed after a couple months. This was a small internal leak, not the overflowing people get when the basket or caraffe is inserted improperly. I didn't have my reciept, so I bought a second one. It worked three months, then the thermostatic switch quit. I kept my reciept, and inquired about warranty repair. My concern was that I would spend more on postage than the product is worth. I called the help line to find out about their policies. They would not even answer my questions without me supplying personal informstion, including my phone number. No way am I going to give them my phone number. They told me to get my question answered elsewhere (without telling me where) and hung up on me. So I took it back to the place of purchase and exchanged it for a new one. My latest coffee maker has bad electronics out of the box. The display shows wrong segments, but the clock may actually be working. I just use the manual button, so I don't care. I expect more problems withing a month or so, and at that time, warranty or not, I WILL NOT HAVE A BLACK AND DECKER PRODUCT IN MY HOME! Good design, but poor quality componants. Very rude customer service (Motto: "We're not happy until you'r not happy.").

The juicer seems well made and has a powerful motor but it takes an enormous amount of food to produce a little bit of juice because a lot of the fiber, which you want, goes to the pulp holder.  So there is right much loss there and I think it's due to the wire mesh basket being very fine.  If it were less fine, it would be a really great product but it makes the difference in an "ok" product versus a "great" product.

You need to get out more. Just the fact that you are looking at this page and are thinking of upgrading your Microsoft Office makes it clear that you have a problem. Don't believe the Microsoft advertisement featuring dinosaurs to announce "Microsoft Office Has Evolved." It hasn't. This is a mature product. It doesn't matter if you use Office 1997, 2000 or 2003. They are all the same. The good, the bad and the ugly. It is all still here. Maybe a few bugs have been fixed. Most haven't, and there are always new bugs. If Microsoft took the time to really improve the software, that would be one thing. But they don't.
Here is an example. You are in Outlook. You call up a contact and want to send that person a letter. You need to print an envelope, but there is no command to do so. There is no button to click. You can't right click anywhere to print an envelope. I am not making this up. Outlook has been out for almost ten years and multiple upgrades, and Microsoft still hasn't gotten around to implementing functionality to print a single envelope. Your only option (the on-line support confirms this) is to perform a mail merge. This is an elaborate process that is designed for printing thousands of envelopes for a bulk mailing. It involves opening multiple windows and setting all sorts of settings. You have to go through the ENTIRE PROCESS just to print a single envelope! What is more, the mail merge feature has bugs in it. It leaves blank lines in addresses that look atrocious, and it drops country names from addresses. It gives you options as to how you want country names treated in addresses, but these all do nothing. Whatever option you select, Outlook leaves countries out of addresses when it prints envelopes.
I could go on, but I won't. If you are using Office 2000 or even Office 1997, you aren't missing out on anything. There is absolutely no reason to shell out $400 for new software that does all the same things in all the same ways with mostly the same bugs.

I recently purchased this coffee maker.  I loved the idea of being able to grind &amp; brew at the same time.  I am VERY disappointed with this coffee maker.  The coffee it makes is OK but you need to use a lot of coffee beans because some of the ground beans don't make it to the filter.  The left over coffee clumps up due to the moisture in the unit so the grinder needs to be washed after EVERY use.  I'm disappointed this coffee maker doesn't work better &amp; I'm returning to my separate grinder &amp; coffee maker.

The assertions of this work and others of this ilk cannot be disproved. It is impossible to provide proof that you don't create your own reality. Supposedly, if you think the correct thoughts, you will create desired outcomes. If you do not have your desired outcomes, it is your own fault, because you obviously haven't thought the correct thoughts. If these ideas could be disproved, then if people did not manifest whatever they thought, we could conclude that the idea that they create their own reality is incorrect. 
But no. The idea that you create your own reality can never be proved incorrect for many reasons. If people thought the correct thoughts but didn't get what they wanted, they either didn't really think correctly, didn't think the thoughts for long enough, or don't believe they genuinely deserve whatever they want to manifest. Notice how it is utterly impossible to prove the idea of creating your own reality wrong. That is, no evidence can ever be interpreted in a way that suggests that you do not create your own reality. If an idea can't be proved wrong, well, it can be proved right, either.
At first, the notion that you create your own reality seems rather harmless. Actually, it has the potential to create considerable distress. 
The genuine tragedy behind this set of ideas is that it makes people who are truly suffering blame themselves. Those who are poor, abused, handicapped, etc. are led to believe that they have brought these conditions on themselves. Perhaps those who origninated these ideas thought that they might motivate folks who are poor or handicapped or abused. In fact, those who are already suffering often feel worse because they think they have brought their conditions on themselves. 
There is an extra layer of damage that arises from the notion that you create your own reality. Changing thoughts actually does have a meaningful impact on mood and behavior. (This is probably what Epictetus and others meant by the power of thoughts.) Therapies that have proven effective often rely on challenging maladaptive thoughts so people can feel better and build meaningful lives. 
Unfortunately, people who have endured the kind of unfalsifiable reasoning put forward in works like this one are apprehensive about using the effective therapies. The effective therapies seem reminiscent of the notion that you create your own reality, an idea that made them miserable in the past. 
So this work is not only untrue, it is potentially damaging.

This review is from: Transformers (DVD)
      
Some day Michael Bay may be involved in a movie that isn't a clone of a previous production. This movie is nothing but Armageddon with robots.  Having ( thank God ) never seen it in a theater the first time I viewed it in HD DVD it felt like I'd seen it before. After a half hour I realized that I had seen it several times only it was called Armageddon. Earth in danger-check    
Lots of shots of helicopters-check ( I swear he has some twisted attraction to them )    
Bullets flying-check    
Everyday guy to the rescue-check.  
I swear the scores could be swapped and you'd never know the difference (Pearl Harbor as well ). If someone were to take the time to go through both movies I'd bet they could find at least a dozen identical camera shots.
If you loved Armageddon or the Rock and don't mind the same thing in a different package you'll love this. Myself I'm had enough of Bay's endless clone movies.

Before I make any purchase I try to look around and find the most affordable and reliable solution. However, I wish I took more care into doing so when researching my external hard drive. Lets spill out a little tale.
I was recently switching my Windows laptop over to a Linux build. Before doing so I backed up all of my data and client's data onto my 500GB Seagate External hard drive. After awhile of fooling around on the distribution and realizing the emulation capabilities were not what I hoped of some Windows based programs I switched back. (No hard feelings Linux, I still love you and use you in other ventures.) However when I went to plug my Seagate hard drive in nothing happened. I went and opened it up and the drive looked like it was completely blank. I unplugged it and switched over to my desktop. This time all the folders were there, but empty. Shut everything down checked connections, pins, made sure everything was plugged in and then powered everything on. Again, no data was shown.
In somewhat of a panic since a clients project was due that week I contacted their customer support, who seems to work more off of sales then to help. While I was on with the representative who took forever to respond between inquiries I started researching Seagates data recovery and analysis tools. When I mentioned these to the customer support he said "DO NOT DO ANYTHING TO YOUR HARD DRIVE. SHUT EVERYTHING DOWN AND DO NOT TOUCH IT." Yes, caps. Then being told that Seagate's "Remote Data Recovery" service would cost close to $1400 I promptly left. 
After searching and trying various options I did eventually get my data off of the hard drive. However it was a daunting task. 
I would advise anyone, who needs to backup their data to stay away from Seagate. I have yet to use any other physical back up solution. I rely heavily on Amazon's amazing S3 services. So, buyers, if you happen to be revamping your system and want to buy an external hard drive go ahead, get a Seagate. They will only cost you $1500. Or, you can try out S3 and pay pennies per month for only the space that you use.

I bought this toothbrush on the recommendation of my dentist.  I've been using it for almost 5 months now, and I have to say, I'm not sure it's working as well as it should be.  I seem to be getting more plaque, and in spots I didn't get plaque before.  Plus, I can feel that my teeth aren't as "clean" and smooth as they should be in the back.  I've started using a regular toothbrush on them afterwards, which solves the problem, but I thought the Sonicare was supposed to be a super cleaner.  Also, I agree with other reviewers about the brush heads.  Mine looks very worn at this point--in fact, it began looking that way after just a couple of months.  I bought one for my kid as well, and his teeth are also showing more plaque (and the brush head looks even worse than mine, though he's been using it for about 4 months instead of 5).  So I'm not sure this is worth it--I'm going to talk to our dentist and dental hygienist at our next checkups.  (No problems other than that, by the way--the vibration/pressure takes a little getting used to, but the "easy start" feature helps a lot.  If you don't keep the toothbrush constantly in its charger, the recharging takes a very long time--too long, for instance, if you're on vacation, so bring an extra brush along.)

You used to be able to do five returns at no extra cost, but now it's $9.95 for each additional return.  So they RAISED the cost substantially and DECREASED the services available to you.

I then contacted a tech friend of mine in Folsom who works for Geek Squad who informed I should have talked with him first before I ever thought of purchasing the "Office 2007 Nightmare" (as they call it) because it has some serious bugs, freezes and shut-down issues in the core of the program which effects many other software programs installed on your computer. 
He also told me that Office 2007 uses a whole new file extension ( .docm &amp; .docx to name a few ) which can not be read or viewed on older versions of Office until Microsoft releases a plug-in that actually works. 
I was told that if I want a good, stable, reliable and multi-extension "Office-type" software suite for my Windows Vista OS I should purchase one of the current Windows Vista compatible versions like WordPerfect or most any software other then Office 2007!
Just a word of warning.
I returned this software to Amazon.com and went with Word Perfect Office X3 which came with more software for a lesser price and no headache.

I received this item as a Christmas present.  I have used Sandisk products before and other family members have this exact model.
My player has a few issues.
Surprisingly, the one thing that everyone else had a problem with, I didn't - the audio jack is fine.  The problem I had started from Day One:
Randomly (well, about every forty songs) my player likes to start a song on max-volume, then freeze all controls for about six seconds.  Yes, that means the Fuze blasts my music uber-loud, where I then have to yank the ear-buds out and fiddle with the buttons until the song changes.
I was prepared to suck it up and deal with it.  But then (just now), I had another volume attack, so I changed the song and tossed the player on my bed.  The screen went black, because I have it set to a 5-second background.  When I checked a few moments later, the player had appeared to have turned off.
And it won't turn back on.  Even when I repeatedly plugged it into a computer and thwacked it a few times.
As a product, it's a good mp3 player.  But the bugs?  No thanks.

A friend kept raving about an online movie called, "The Secret." He appeared to be well- read and well-versed in marketing and business development, so I was intrigued that something had gotten him this excited.  The online movie was $4.95 compared to the CD set of $29.95.  What could I lose by watching a documentary about achieving success for 90 minutes for less than $5.00? After sitting down and watching the movie, I came away asking myself, "What did I miss?" What did my friend see that I didn't causing him to start a "Laws Of Attraction" group?  As a practitioner within the field of human development, this information was Self-Mastery 101.  The people interviewed in the movie fell right into place with the ominous, seemingly arcane backdrop.  I could easily conclude that my extensive reading on the subject matter made the movie appear overly simplistic.  But, an adherent of any of the world religions should echo similar sentiments.  Instead of a deity, "The Secret" credits the indomitable will of the human spirit.  It doesn't use those words, but one could easily surmise the point.  "The Secret" uses the basic tenets of world religions mixed with the motivational messages of the 1990's shrouded in a "Da Vinci Code"-like motif.     
The real "secret" is the effective ways by which religion, motivation and marketing is synergistically molded to create a sense of newness out of archaic messages.  Should you watch "The Secret?"  Yes, not merely for the oft- quoted principles projected, but to get a sense of how concepts presented persuasively can capture the imagination of the populous in ways that traditional religion has not.

I have had my Linksys router for 3 years.  I also had to get a bridge to extend the range because it couldn't go through walls very well.  They used to have free support until just recently.  I had to call them a lot because sometimes the bridge or router somehow lost the address.
My beef is with the cost of support.  3.99 a minute. ( I don't know if that includes listening for several minutes to bad music.) You can get 3 months support for $199, 6 months for $299 or 1 year for $499!!!  I can tell you I spent many hours talking to tech support so I would go elsewhere.

This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)
      
I went into New Moon wanting to like it, and in certain sections I will admit that I did.  Naturally I am a fan of Meyer's previous book, Twilight, and was expecting to see at least a hearty attempt to recreate the magic that Twilight spun in excess.  New Moon revolves like a flat tire; the story was trying to get somewhere, but the going was rough, uncomfortable, and by the ending all I could think of was the word "unsatisfactory".
In New Moon we are tossed into a story of separated lovers, and the book makes no attempt to tone down the obvious allusions to Shakespeare.  This is Romeo and Juliet, Edward and Bella style.  It gets so heavy handed that in more than a few places Bella is actively casting herself, Edward and Jacob into prominent roles in the play, and Edward takes the suicide plot and runs with it far beyond necessary.  I appreciate the attempts by the author to explain just how deep the connection is between Bella and Edward, but the Romeo and Juliet plotline is a recycled one at best, and it quickly grows sour when layered so thickly over the narrative.  
Besides Bella and Edward's love `til death or suicide drama, Jacob Black is a revitalizing breath of fresh air.  The newly inherited ability to turn into a werewolf adds Jacob in as an interesting dynamic to Bella's life (and love life) and I sincerely hope Meyer continues to play with the meaning of what Jacob is to Bella besides a second option to Edward.  It would be unfair to cast Jacob as a plainly obvious second fiddle to Edward when he has so much potential.  
As far as Bella, while at first her clumsy antics were amusing they also fall flat in New Moon.  Bella's accidental ability to injure herself flies off the chart in New Moon, so much so that I found myself skimming past her new and not so ingenious ways of torturing herself for the fleeting seconds when her subconscious summons up Edward's voice in order to tell her how to not act like a clumsy fool.  There had to be a better way of passing her time without Edward.  For one: growing up would have suited Bella nicely.  She's 18, yet everyone in New Moon manages to treat her as either an invalid or an infant, either saving her from herself or actively carting, hauling, or carrying her around.  The moment Bella stands up for herself and takes care of herself will be a landmark in this book series, because she spends so much time mourning Edward's loss and so much time trying to patch Jacob into the holes Edward previously filled you must wonder when Bella can fix herself rather than relying on her male friends to figure it out for her.  
By the end of the book, the nature of Bella and Edward's relationship changes little. Edward comes back, scolds Bella for having acted so insane in his absence because of course he loves her, Bella is shocked that he does indeed love her (although I thought that was already established, and if not why was he trying to commit suicide if he didn't love her?) and Edward's still immaturely gung ho on suicide, no matter Bella's say in it.  
Overall, New Moon is a disappointing follow-up.  Things felt rushed and ultimately pointless, not to mention the numerous typos found in a first edition copy.  Twilight is still a wonderful story, but I can't say that I'm liking where the story is going.

This was completely useless for my baby girl. She was entirely to small for it, and she could very easily wiggle out of it. 
Receiving blankets work just as well and you can get two packs of 4 for the price of one of the swaddlers. You can also use the blankets for a dozen other things as well, not with the swaddler. 
Sorry, we didn't like this one.

I was mislead into buying the PA State tax since I work in PA and live in Maryland. The software was prompting me to buy it and turns out, I do not need to file anything to PA because of agreements between the states. Too bad the software didn't share this information until after I had wasted $39.95. If I'm lucky there will be a class action suit some day and I can get my money back. Guess it's my fault for not being better informed, but according to all the advertising hype that's why I spent the initial $59.95 for this software anyway. Oh well. Maybe there is hope with Tax Cut.

Sorry about the length of this, but I am absolutely livid about this book. I am angry at myself for reading the trash, but exponentially more furious at Stephenie Meyer for writing it. This book is an insult. If you are a fan of the series, over the age of 12 and/or have an IQ above 50, then DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. PLEASE listen to me. Thank God I didn't spend a penny on it.
Everything that made the romance between Edward and Bella so great has absolutely been destroyed. Gone are the cute, innocent teenagers who fall into an impossible romance in the cafeteria. I don't think I can ever read or watch Twilight again. I mean, I always slightly cringed when it was obvious that a modern teenager had nothing to do with any of these books. (ex. "Holy Crow?" Even my GRANDMOTHER doesn't say that.) Or the sometimes over-the-top sappy exposition and dialogue. But I could deal. But this BOOK. It was like watching my childhood stuffed animal get... um, defiled. It was that horrifying. 
I understand the concept of author's prerogative, but ANY author has a responsibility to 1) Keep leaps of logic to a minimum, which definitely excludes some weird, mutant child of the corn, 2) Keep the plots and characters consistent throughout the series within the framework which the author has set up, and 3) Follow basic rules of writing and editing a novel designed for an intelligent audience. All 3 of which were shockingly snubbed in Breaking Dawn. 
Please, please, please. Do yourself a favor and stop reading at Eclipse, or better yet, at New Moon or Twilight, and fill in the very few blanks for yourself. I will never criticize an author for having an ambiguous ending again. Just click on "Most Helpful Reviews" and you will see the many, many people who feel the same way. 
*SPOILERS AHEAD, but you should probably read this part anyway to realize just how awful this book is*
Here are a few of the many, many problems I have with this book:
1) So Edward and Bella get married and that part's pretty cute, even though I think it would have made more sense to transform her first, since that's how they're planning to spend their marriage. They get married at the very beginning of the book, and Bella doesn't even really want to. She agreed because she wants to get laid. Wow, warms the heart.
Then begins the vomit-inducing 700 pages. 
2) Edward and Bella have sex. A lot. Effectively ruining the innocence of their cute romance and turning it into some trashy, thinly-veiled-porn novella you buy at the airport. Sex is at the very least alluded to in almost every scene they have together. They like it. We get it.
But that's not the worst part. Even while she is HUMAN. Um, Edward is a creature who literally turns iron into dust and moves as fast as a speeding car without breaking a sweat. And she wants him to have SEX with her as she is?! How the HELL would that be 1) Enjoyable for him, and 2) Not life-threatening for her?! Not only does Bella whine, manipulate, and cry her way into doing this outrageously stupid and selfish thing (totally decimated my respect for her character), but then Edward, totally out of character, gives into her crap and agrees to TRY. TRY?! Why don't I just TRY to juggle chainsaws?! And for what? So she can GET SOME a little bit ahead of schedule? She can't bear to have her first time unless she's worried about Edward breaking her in HALF?! If I was Edward, had Bella even suggested such a thing I would have first laughed myself silly, then run screaming in the other direction from such a reckless lunatic. That whole thing really pissed me off.
3) Pregnant. 17-year-old vampire Edward and 18-year-old human Bella. Ew. Ew. Ew. I can accept the marriage, because Edward will never get older, and they love each other. But when I got to that part, and both of their reactions to it, I wanted to scream I was so angry. It is just so small and stupid, so out of place in the story, and CONTRIVED. Ugh! As so many other people said, I thought it was Fanfiction I was reading, not a published work, let alone from the actual author. I'm curious as to what Meyer was smoking when she thought this was an appropriate plot line. But it got worse. What suspension of disbelief I had left broke, and I became permanently removed from the story. I began to hate Bella, and resent Edward's cardboard characterization. 
4) Their weird mutant spawn literally kills Bella slowly. And she couldn't be more thrilled about it.
 The fact that Meyer had made the ridiculously immature, but lovable and relatable teenager Bella PREGNANT was bad enough. But then it is with some weird, unknown mutant parasite, that saps all her strength, breaks several of her bones (including her SPINE) and causes various bruises, and makes her drink HUMAN BLOOD. During Bella's pregnancy, I was literally shuddering with disgust on almost every page. That is not an exaggeration. And I'm 19. 
No joke, I was rooting for the wolves to attack the Cullens and kill the thing. Bella and Edward's characters fly so far off their character rails that you can't even see them any more. Bella whole-heartedly embraces the thing while it slowly kills her, and Edward does nothing but hopelessly mope about it. 
5) The birth and Bella's transformation. 
UGGGGHHHH. This was hands-down the most disturbing passage I have ever read. I had to put the book down to take some deep breaths several times out of anger and disgust, and then wrestle with myself about whether or not to keep reading multiple times on one page. My Edward and Bella. Who fell in love as lab partners, and cutely fought because of their stubborn personalities. 
Here, Bella, dieing and screaming in agony, vomits blood while the mutant baby inside of her destroys her body, internal organs and spine. Edward uses his teeth to bite the baby out of her uterus. Bella dies and then Edward injects vampire venom into her heart with a syringe.
This is how Bella starts her new life with him. TOTAL Slap. In. The. Face. 
I was ready to drive to Arizona, find Stephenie Meyer's house, and burn it down.
6) Renesmee. This is what Bella names their child. Ruh. Nez. May. A combination of Renee and Esme. Seriously?
Seriously, Stephenie Meyer? 
Why didn't you just sell a book that just says, "To all my fans: F%*# YOU."
When Bella tells her father that the baby's middle name is Carlie, I thought, "well, that's not so bad." Then she says that it's a combination of "Charlie" and "Carlisle." 
Again, I considered driving to Arizona. 
7) Bella as vampire. One of the things that made this series so great was how seemingly-impossible and different the relationship with her and Edward was. She literally had to give up her humanity, her family, and her whole life, in order to have a future with him, but she decided that the love of her life was worth it. It's a difficult, heart-breaking choice and I really liked that. But no. All of a sudden, Bella has it all. She is infinitely more beautiful, graceful, powerful, inexplicably becomes supermom at 18, and still retains all the parts of her humanity she was afraid to lose. She has a child, she stays in Forks, and tells her family. There are mentions of her carrying wads of five thousand dollars like it was chump change, which is BEYOND out of character. Waiters "gasp" at her beauty. She also becomes sickeningly vain. Then they run off to a little storybook cottage her new family has just given her for free, and Edward and Bella "make love" in it like rabbits every chance they get. If Bella had any relatability left, especially for teenagers, she lost it. This also applies to the believability of the story as a whole and the complexity of the Twilight characters.
8) Jacob and Renesmee. 
Jacob, the cute and friendly guy (but also rapist-in-training in Eclipse) who is painfully in love with and loyal to Bella, imprints (falls in love with) on her newborn BABY. This is beyond sick and pedophilic. But it's ok. He's willing to "share" the baby with Bella and Edward. Bella and Edward quickly realize this whole thing is great. WHAT the F#*%?!
If it weren't bad enough that this annoyingly perfect child that absolutely everyone in the book ADORES exists, she is destined to be with JACOB. At the end of the book, Edward calls Jacob SON. I just shuddered again WRITING that. 
9) The climax, or lack thereof.
After several stupid and pointless pages, and GIANT letdowns with weak plotlines about secret messages and hidden motives that go nowhere, nothing happens. Bella puts up her magical, super-scary mental shield around everyone and all of a sudden the infinitely powerful and wizened vampire royalty runs away, peeing their pants. 
In conclusion, Breaking Down is not only literary trash that should have returned from the editor's office soaked in red ink, but it also completely destroys the story as a whole. It makes me sick to my stomach what this book did to Edward and Bella in my mind and everyone else's. I will never read a single page of this absolute rubbish again, and hopefully I'll forget about it in a few years. I pray this book will never make it into theaters. 
Do yourself a favor and don't buy this.

What to say about BD?  I did not like the book as much as the first three.  My daughter (15) recommended it since � of her school mates were reading it.  She knew I was searching for a book that would catch my interest.  I read Twilight in two days and it left me wanting more, thus I checked out  New Moon at the library.  Again I craved for more; then I moved to Eclipse.  
Breaking Dawn was a disappointment.  I like the fact that the major characters got a happy ending, but where is the fight the dertmination to get what you deserve? So Bella discovers that she has a gift, but where is the struggle the passion that we so in the first books? Jacob definitely got the short end of the stick.  I love the fact that he moved on but is that enough for th Jacob that we all love and care about? 
The editing need some help.  There are some grammatical issues that could have been avoided.

I bought this because of the reputation of the WRT54G, not realizing that v5 of the hardware is completely different from the older versions and doesn't run Linux. Even with the latest firmware, it is consistently unstable and will lock up and stop functioning every few days. I'd advise voting with your wallet and staying away from the WRT54G v5, and thinking about a WRT54GL which is the "classic" version of the hardware that runs Linux. Unfortunately, this seems to be more limited in availability than the cut-down version.

I purchased this unit in November 2007. It is now December of the same year and the "hold" button will not release after it has been depressed until I turn the unit off. So now when my mouth fills with water, I have to turn the unit off to stop the stream of water, expel the water from my mouth, turn the unit back on and continue in this fashion until finished. 
The other problem I've noticed is the pressure starts out very weak and usually doesn't build until the water in the tank is about half gone.
I expected more from the Waterpik Ultra, but based on it's performance thus far, I would not recommend it.

Season Average= 2.275
OK to begin with this season was better than Season 6 (but just) what let it down big time though was the way the season ended &amp; it has to go down as not only Smallville's worst ever season finales but one of the worst in television ever, but more on that later.
First with the good. There were new characters &amp; mini arcs this season that were actually to do with the mithos &amp; although some worked (Veritas, Bizzaro, BRAINiac) others didn't (Laura-Zor-El). Although the worst of them has to be the Julian clone plot which rightfully was finished as soon as it started &amp; was never mentioned by anyone again (Even Lois eventhough he was her ex-boyfriend?)
What really dragged this season down was the unnecessary soap opera romance rubbish the obvious Clark/Lana. I was actually looking forward to an actual honest to God talk between these two characters this season but all be learned was that Lana has the personality of a cardboard cutout &amp; Clark is an idiot &amp; that wasn't something we already didn't know.
But worse of all (yes worser than Clana) was the Jimmy &amp; Chloe relationship that's basically been forced upon us so much that I'm actually starting to hate Jimmy with the same verocity as I do Lana. And if you want to see how easy it is to hate Jimmy just check out Sleeper cos that is what the title says.
But unlike Season 6 which was mainly Soap Opera rubbish, Season 7 at least as I stated earlier tried to offer some alternatives but these were either poorly executed (Laura, Zor-El) stupid (Lex gets shot in the head &amp; survives via a device that you'd also see on the cartoon Superfriends) and dissapointing (Brainiac, it admittingly had its moments but at the end crashed to a dissapointing end, but more on that later).
The Season did start of well though Bizzaro &amp; Kara were excellent episodes but Kara the character herself didn't really serve no real purpose to the show alot of the time except for looking nice &amp; the next few were just riducilous &amp; pointless episodes about this fact. Although she was awesome when she came back in Traveller.
Jor-El is still an a-hole &amp; freezes Clark for no real reason before Bizzaro comes back makes love to Lana dies in the most stupid way before we get for a change some decent drama from Clark &amp; Lana although a few episodes later they are all lovey dovey, until...
VERITAS
This is one of the best episodes of this season &amp; one of Smallville's best for ages. It follows on from the excellent Traveller episode where we learn than Lionel &amp; a few others knew of Clark's arrival &amp; years before he landed on Earth were waiting for him. This episodes makes some compelling discoveries about characters &amp; motivations, especially Lionel &amp; I'll admit the episode he dies in Descent although dissapointing wasn't bad at all but this was enough to actually convince that after 3 &amp; a half years Smallville was back on track but low &amp; behold... 
THE ENDING
Discluding Apocolypse which was an ok episode but still had nothing to do with anything except false forshadowing &amp; fan service. The episodes Sleeper, Quest &amp; Arctic have to go down as some of the worst Smallville episodes ever.
First there's Sleeper, which I've already explained earlier, then there's Quest where Robert Picardo of Star Trek Voyager fame plays Jason Teague who for some reason wants to kill Clark cos he didn't kill Lex even though Clark according to him is our last hope??? Oh whatever.
But then there's Arctic which wraps up all the great stuff that was started off in the Traveller, Veritas &amp; Descent trilogy in one of the most ugliest &amp; terrible yet stupid ways possible. I was most tempted to cut those 3 earlier episodes grades just cos of the mess it caused but making these out to not be great because of some hack writers (Strike or no Strike) just wouldn't be fair.

I bought this product yesterday and it was supposed to install in 10 minutes   but it took over three hours calling the tech support and talking with someone who could hardly speak English!. I am very dissatisfied with this product because instead of automatically being installed I had to change all the IP Address, Sub Net etc manually. I think a $20 router would do better. I also had an older version of D-Link that stopped working within 6 months. So I am all done with D-Link and would never even look at their products.

Well, the first two weeks were fine but now internet connection is extremely slow via both wireless and ethernet and iTunes streams keep rebuffering(cutting out) every 5 seconds making iTunes streams unlistenable.
When connecting my computer directly to my cable modem, internet is fast and ITunes is fine (no rebuffering). Just tried connecting a friend's old Netgear router to my computer and cable modem and both internet connection and iTunes streams are fine. So the problem has gotta be with this Linksys WRT54GL router. It's obviously gone bad.
What a bummer!  I'm returning this and will look for a  better quality,  more reliable router. 
I previously used a Linksys WRT54G that belonged to a house mate and had constant connection drop offs so when I read the 4 and 5 star reviews for the WRT54GL I expected router nirvana but, alas, no joy. How disappointing.

TurboTax has gone to another new low.  They tried to sneak in an additional charge per tax return.  Didn't they learn anything back in 2003 when they tried to limit printing to one computer?
Yes, they have now deleted the extra charges.  But how can we ever trust them again?  I am used to just ordering the software I need from Intuit.  This year I had already ordered it before I knew anything about the controversy over the extra charges.  Plus, they raised the price.
I have also ordered TaxCut Home and Business, which I understand will do the same thing as TurboTax Home and Business, PLUS, TurboTax Business.  This is a savings of around $170, including state.  I do not believe TaxCut is as robust and comprehensive as TurboTax, but I am willing to give up some things in order to do business with a company I can trust in the future.  Plus, a $170 savings in this economy is pretty substantial...
I'll use both company's software and decide whose I'll use next year.   But I can easily see saying a final goodbye to TurboTax!

How was the producer ever able to secure the participation of so many competing self-help product-peddling marketers and bring them together under one superstore roof called "The Secret"?
What a line-up of "teachers." Joe Vitale, "metaphysician." Michael Beckwith, "visionary."  John Demartini and Bob Proctor, "philosophers." These titles appear to be misnomers when you check out their actual credentials. Their Web sites make them seem like ... well, something less than spiritual teachers. 
At the affiliated online superstore -- dear God! (and, yes, the link is "Secret Superstore") -- one can buy genie lamps and gratitude rocks [note to self: start selling stones from driveway]. Did I miss the Burger King tie-in?  
How dare they abuse the good names of the Buddha, Emerson, etc., in this grotesqueness. 
I don't disagree with the idea of the "Laws of Attraction." That's old stuff. However, this particular application is the very definition of crassness.

First of all let me say that I brought this EEEPC 2GB for writing purposes as I am a writer and I wanted something small to carry around instead of carrying my bigger laptop everywhere. I love the size, and I brought outside storage for it to be able to carry info to both my main laptop and this one. 
My complaint is that it won't get on the internet, which in my case it is not really that big of a deal for what I want to use it for, but if you are buying a EEEPC FOR INTERNET, I would say this is not the one to buy. After purchase I tried to contact the company for support, not very supportive nor seem to stand behind the product, getting through to a live person is extremely hard and may take a few hours and several attempts. Still won't get me on the internet.
I felt it important to notify others who may be thinking of purchasing one of these little seemingly dream machines simply to let others know of this situation.
If you don't care about the internet then it is a dream to take along for writing like I do. Very portable and easy to access the programs in the PC which is Open Office, very easy to use so simple even a child can use it. 
As for me I will use it for what I brought it for, but will be looking for something better so that I can write and also have the internet if I desire.

This is probably a fine wireless router for those who use Windows, but it REALLY doesn't work well with Mac OS X, especially the Mac laptops  (though apparently it does work somewhat for some Mac people). There is a lot more detail in the how-to article posted here, and especially in the comments section after: 
[...]
I tried all the tricks in that article but had no luck with mine, so I wound up returning it.  Fortunately, Amazon's service in that regard is excellent. I understand this router used to use a more open and flexible Linux system, but has since changed to something else. But Linksys really should specify that this product simply wasn't designed to work well with the Mac. From the manual and the CD you would think Windows was the only OS on the market! Also, IMO, as Linksys made a good reputation for how "hackable" the original was, they should have changed the model number when they removed the original functionality. This is probably a classic example of a big company "coasting" on the previous product's reputation. Rather sad.

Just packed up my second one to be returned. I never even got to the point of making coffee. Both units leaked water out of the main tank, and not just a little. The first one leaked so bad that I had several  cups of water on the counter before I dumped it back out and this was while I was trying to put coffee in the filter. Don't waste your time.

This is just for the record, and to prepare you for a disappointment if you have my bad luck.  My first Panasonic breadmaker gave me about 12 years of good service and just slowly died of old age; I had no complaints.  I was just sorry to see it go.  I bought this new model breadmaker (SD-YD250) last December (2005). It has been producing SUPERB bread (about two a week, wheat or cinnamon-raisin).  I have been immensely pleased with this machine.  But now it has just suddenly failed.  The manual is useless when it comes to trouble-shooting, and the website is a gigantic run-around: I think there is no help at all for Panasonic breadmakers on the Panasonic web site, though it takes some time to find this fact out.  But now I am getting quite a run-around trying to get some action on the warranty.  I am disappointed with Panasonic. I had thought they were a better company.  It could be that I am just a very unlucky person, but I thought I would put my experience on record.... (Panasonic automatically sends me to a repair facility which says it does not repair breadmakers, and also says I should contact Panasonic....I am locked in a loop!)

Premier Gentle Spray Anti-Bark Dog Collar This was the third Premier Gentle Spray Anti-Bark Dog Collar in less than two years for a vocal miniature schnauzer. It is very effective, but the collars don't last very long. The first one lasted about six months before dying. The second lasted a few months before the internal reservoir sprang a leak. The third one was defective when we received it. Fortunately, simply wearing the broken collar has some residual effect on reducing barking.

I purchased the Fuze after doing lots of research. After receiving it promptly from an Amazon merchant(bzseller), I charged it. Started playing with its features, and while saving a voice recording, it crashed (white screen). Called Sansa support (very helpful), which instructed me to reset. Crashed a second time. Reset. Tried to update firmware, but got error message.  Tried to encode video from different sources (DVD,MP4,AVI) using bundled Media Manager, which locked up on two separate computers, requiring reboots.
I gave it one star because the radio worked fine, and when it was functional, audio(mp3,wma) quality was high. I returned it to the merchant (no hassles;full refund), then purchased a Sony Walkman NWZ-E436F. A little more expensive(4GBSony vs 2GBFuze)but problem free, great sound, and crisp seamless video playback using SUPER encoder set at VIDEO mp4;H.264/AVC;320:240;384kbps and AUDIO 44.1K;96kbps. For DVDs,use DVD Decrypter or Smartripper and deselect all audio language streams except English). The Sansa did not recognize files encoded using many different variations of audio/video settings.

This camcorder makes me sick! I got it in october and used it for a few weeks and it worked well. But three weeks after ive been using it it started to get these gray bars across the screen so I contacted sony(there tech support is a joke they should be ashamed!)and sony said to reset it so I reset it and it didn't work so I contacted sony again and they said that it was a faulty camera. So I sent it back and I got a new one.You won't believe this! It started having the same problem so I called sony AGAIN and they told me absolute rubbish an didn't even tell me anything I could do to fix it!!!! So this time I took it back to the store and bought a JVC Everio GZ-MG330 and it is better than this piece of garbage by a long shot!

The juicer looks good but that is about it. I was in a hurry when I purchased it but I wished I would have heeded the advice from the bad reviews for this juicer and purchased from a different manufacturer. I've only used it a dozen times and the rim cover broke off - it was glued on to the housing. The machine is poorly built: plastic coating is peeling off; parts are cracking and falling apart - it is all plastic; the motor is very touchy- it shuts down in the middle of the cycle and you have to take it apart to start it up again. Avoid this juicer or you will me very disappointed like I have been. I feel like it going to break down any time even though I have pampered it like a baby.

...but this device did not hold up for one day against my 9 year old, 20 lbs soaking wet Sheltie.  I came home to discover she had knocked it around quite a bit so that the top part had come off, the food was eaten and the plastic cover over the control panel had been chewed.  Perhaps the two stars should be assigned to my food crazed pet, but she's not exactly a junk yard dog. 
Programming the device was also very challenging and I'm almost always fine with that sort of thing. The instructions were poorly written and the steps counter-intuitive.  
The feeder did seem to work just fine when I did a trial run at dinner the night before leaving it alone with the dog while I was at work.  As I said, this might work very well for cats.  It simply isn't sturdy enough for many dogs, even of the smallish variety.

There were still some great parts and it was in this book in particular I came to love the Cullen family and felt the author really helped explain them best. I always felt any references to Bella's mother was an after thought especially when it came to bigger things in the 4th book. This is was my least favorite of the series.

Bought this (Omron HJ-112 Digital Pedometer) as a replacement for the same model that had just worn out after five years of intensive use.  The older one was performing erratically.  Wouldn't keep the aerobic steps consistently, i.e., would stop counting aerobic steps even though I had not stopped aerobic walking.  
The new pedometer has many of the problems as the older one, including some new ones. In the first two days, it failed to account for 25 minutes of aerobic walking.  It still does that occasionally. Most frustrating is that it will stop counting aerobic steps even when one has been walking and continues to walk aerobically.  You can walk for 35 or 40 minutes, continue walking and not have any of that counted.  It may or may not resume after another 10 minutes or so, but you almost certainly will have "lost" anywhere from 2 to 25 minutes of aerobic walking.  I've now noted when I start aerobic walking and when I stop and have noticed that the discrepancy is anywhere from 5 to 25 minutes between what the pedometer has and what I know I've walked.  Seems to be a quality control issue, and that the pedometer is faulty. I've waited too long to return to Amazon, but it's still under warranty and I can return it to Omron for replacement, although I'm not sure that's what I want to do.  Could be replacing it with another pedometer just as erratic as this one is.
Buyer beware. If you get it and have the same issues, return to Amazon immediately. And look for another pedometer.

If I had not known that this was directed by Woody Allen, I would have quickly come to that conclusion because every person with more than one line of dialogue walked, talked, gestured, and whined their way through the entire movie. I am constantly amazed at how leading talent will consent to be part of such poor stories. I suppose that performers only make money when they are performing. No matter how well they play their parts, they are all too often  remembered as participants of waste in time, money, film, and the potential  to have accepted a more worthwhile role and film.

Simply put, this product fails to do what it's supposed to do.
Even plugged in, it still does not seem to draw enough power to supply more than three plugged items reliably.  I had a keyboard, dongle, MIDI interface and USB DAW controller plugged in, and each time I restarted my computer, a different item would be unrecognized.
I tried tech support, and they were useless.  Furthermore, they HUNG UP ON ME.  Twice.
Finally a 'senior tech' issued an RMA for me to replace it, but I wasn't about to spend $10 to ship them a $30 unit, only to have it replaced with an IDENTICAL unit that probably wouldn't work as well.  (There are plenty of other bad reviews here to corroborate my suspicions.)
I emailed customer support asking for a refund, but they simply chose to ignore my emails.  I even told them that I would be posting my bad experience here, but apparently they decided that they would rather have the bad publicity than issue a $30 refund.

I purchased this product to replace my broken T1, which was sufficient for me to capture photos and video clips for my baby's growth. After very long research, and debating on another DC or Camcorder, I picked this one based on Amazon's reviews, and more likely, hoped the 1M still shot capability would be good enough, and also utilize the hybrid feature of this machine for my just-bought 4GB MS. Unfortunately, other than the compact sze of this camcorder, nothing was really pleased me: no view finder, just-so so video quality (unless in bright light or outdoor, which I don't use that much), very poor (soft) still image, the photo button will not aid to a stable picture, no snap shot feature during taping, hybrid function does not help a lot, because the 60GB HDD is larger enough for my applications, no thumbnail available for video clips (wondering why the format is different from T1); after all, the price is too high, even for a SONY! Good parts: video clip size is small, comparing to CANON, night shot mode is sharp! and Amazon has a pretty good service system, I've got full refund and bought a CANON SD1100IS instead, and loved it so far. so maybe in the couple of year, another camcorder, but HD for sure.

Have owned this oven now for 2 years.  I thought the temerature control that only allows certain discrete temps would not be a problem, but it is.

My old computer died last week, so I was forced to buy a new one.  I got a VERY good computer - HP tower, with QUAD (not dual) processor, and 3 Gigs of RAM.  I have 2 internal drives at 1 terabyte, and 2 externals at 1 TB total.  No drive has more than 20% space used, and no other software has been installed.
The biggest problem is IT'S SLOW!  When typing an email in Outlook, or a Word document (or Publisher), there is a lag between the time you hit the key and before the character prints.  It's like trying to talk with your own echo - I find myself typing MUCH more slowly than I am actually able.  I HATE THIS, and I'm not the only one with the problem.  Anyone who types for a living has the same complaint.  I've turned off all the Outlook and Word 'add-ins' as many sites recommend trying, to no avail.  A brand new QUAD Pentium with 3 GB of RAM should be able to run this turd of a program.  But no - it's so bloated with new code that the simple act that it was designed for - getting words on the screen - suffers because of it.  Just absurd, Microsoft.
The 'Ribbon' interface and new file 'Save as' tree structure are WAY more cumbersome that the old toolbar.  I just want to get things done - why did they feel the need for such a massive change?  What was wrong with the old system?  I take twice as long now browsing to the folder I want.  Yes, learning new things 'takes time' - but again, EVERYONE was familiar with the standard toolbar and 'browse to file' techniques.  Why change a core skill?  Why expect a business (me) to have to spend time learning this new system?  What exactly was the point, anyway?
So now I am going to have to UNINSTALL this new $279 package (what a waste) and reinstall Office 2003 just to regain my old performance.  And since my last 2003 license died with the old computer (and now cannot be uninstalled to free it up), I'll get the pleasure of dealing with Microsoft to try to recover what I HAVE ALREADY PAID FOR.
The software LOOKS pretty, and has TONS of new features throughout, and that part I like.  But if I can't type without looking every second to see if I got it right, and have to type at 1/3 my normal speed, how productive is that?
Beware - if you type a lot with Office, you should NOT BUY THIS VERSION.
I give it two stars for 'pretty' and ZERO for performance in a typing environment.

I decided to buy this flat iron after reading here some good reviews about it. First of all, it looked USED to me when I first opened the box. There were scratches everywhere. I'm sure it was not a new item, even though I paid for a new one. Then I tried on my dry hair and it worked fine. But since then, I have been using it after washing and blow drying my hair, when it does not work very well. I'm not sure if I'm using it correctly, but I guess it should not be a big deal. If the hair is a little bit curly, it will make it flat, but it's not the same as when you leave a hair saloon, which makes the hair so smoothly and really straight. Not sure where the magic is here. Perhaps my flat iron is already broken and I don't even know about it. Not very happy with this purchase. If someone can give me an idea of what's going on, I would appreciate it. Thanks.

I don't know how anyone didn't notice and mention this glitch in the Amazon reviews before with the Flip HD model, but you DO NOT get a full 60 minutes of recording time! First off the Flip software crashes on me so i never use it. Anyway, the Flip HD tells me on the display that i have a full 60 minutes of recording time left, but all i get is 51 minutes! My DCIM folder is 100% clear with no videos in it. On the Flip website it stated that if you are filming fast moving objects that the video file increases in size, thus giving you less recording time. Well, 2 times i pointed the camera just at my living room wall, where there is no movement whatsoever and each time i only got 51 minutes recording time! I mean i don't want to sound petty but 60 minutes is not that long to record to begin with, why should 9 minutes be missing each and every time??? The camera took nice videos but missing 9 minutes each time i used it was just to annoying, so i sent it back to Amazon. If you are just taking short videos each time i guess you will never notice this problem, but just try to record for 1 HOUR STRAIGHT and you will see what i am talking about!!!

In addition, they do not offer free shipping back and take no responsibility if the unit gets lost. When I sent my unit back (with a tracking number) the USPS were unable to deliver for whatever reason. Therefore, I had to spend more time on the live chat trying to find out why there was nobody to take delivery. Anyway, I finally received a replacement unit today only to discover that if you buy from Amazon, you are only covered as "standard warranty" which means you get a REFURBISHED item!. Byers be aware! I actually went ahead a purchased a WD passport whilst waiting for Iomega to sort things out and I quarantee you that I will not be purchasing any Iomega items in the future!

Someone had a good idea, but the execution is poor.  We bought one of these models from a catalog 6 months ago, but after some malfunctions, we returned it for an exchange.  Unfortunately, the new unit is just as difficut to work and program.
As someone mentioned, maybe your cats would have better luck getting this thing to work!  The instructions are poor and the buttons used to set the programming just don't seem to work much of the time. Quite frustrating.  When the unit works, it's good, but getting it to work correctly is most of the problem.
The bottom line:  We are going to try another product.

If I had read the reviews on this thing would never have bought it. A few minutes set up turned into hours of frustration. When it finally found the internet it dropped it within minutes. Would never know if I was going to be connected or for how long. Amazon was very, very good about sending a replacement. Tried it one time, and when it didn't connect the network, placed back in package and returned.

The device was broken even before I opened the package. The first time I pulled the tape out to measure I heard what sounded like a cracking noise and it would not retract the tape back in to its holder. After breaking open the case I found the reason very cheap metal was used and they didn't even wind the spring the correct way. Pure Junk!!!

Buying this wireless router turned out to be the singularly most frustrating experience I've ever encountered with any product.  When -- after a good deal of difficulty and a long call with customer service -- it finally was up and running, connectivity was only intermittent.  Customer service is a nightmare . . . waiting, waiting, waiting to get a live person . . . then after more than an hour of diagnostic testing they tell me the router is defective (duh) and that I will need to call another number to "apply" for a replacement under the warranty. When I do, I'm told that before they can accept that the product is TRULY defective, more tests will have to be run and that I will need to call tech support again for that.  So I do . . .and after literally two more hours on the phone, they confirm absolutely that the product is defective and that I REALLY can call the other number to "apply" for that replacement . . when I do call the other number (they call it the "RMA Department"), they want a deposit on my credit card before they will ship so they can be assured I'll actually send them the defective one!   After all that incompetence, should I have to entrust them with my credit card information?  And what're they going to do with the defective product??  Sell it to YOU???? . . . . You get the picture.  
I have a NetGear wireless router in my other home that works like a dream.  Steer clear of this Linksys product.

I just checked it out at target. To sum it up it's a $120 toy. It just doesn't deliver on a HD level. The HD recording is a blurred mess. On the DV1 setting the video is near the quality of my miniDV camcorder, but it lacks many features. The fixed lens does not focus on close-up objects. Objects two or more feet away appear fine, but at those distances the audio turns tinny. I would not consider this an equal to a miniDV, nor would I really use it to record home videos. I'm giving it one star because if flat-out does not deliver on what it promises.

So I got this after a co-worker said he loved it, it makes really HOT coffee and is delish! I brewed several cups of coffee and each time, even when I chose the "mug" or double cup serving, it only fills the 10 oz. mug 3/5ths of the way. I have to use 2 pods with a one cup size choice, because the coffee comes out SO WEAK. 
Now let's talk temperature. The only way I could see this coffee being hot enough is if you drink yours black and even then, I can't see anyone thinking it's hot enough. I use milk in my coffee and I have to go through the process of microwaving the milk first or microwaving the cup of brewed coffee with milk added, because the temperature is so sub-par. THe coffee smells great but it brews weak. Maybe they don't put enough grounds in the pod. I'm returning this after 1 day. It's not at all what I expected and as someone else pointed out, it takes up WAY TOO MUCH space for a 1-cup gadget.

The razor blades do not seem to be original Mach3 blades but cheap knockoffs or may be faulty ones.
The first blade  I used did not give a clean shave in one stroke. I thought may be this is an exception, so I took the second one (from the same pack)
but got the same below par results. Still not convinced that this is a faulty product I used a third blade with same poor shave.

I felt ripped off when I read this book. Although I never really thought the series was written well, the books were addicting in a weird sort of way. They were my guilty pleasure. I got BD the night it was released and read it in one sitting. I felt so ripped off. It seemed like everything was done to fast and just to make that happy ending. I was annoyed by the almost anti-climax and the deus ex machina ending. Everything was made just to give the Cullens an edge and make the happy ending. That was it. There was never any real danger. I read the whole book feeling detatched. I'd read it if you've come this far in the series, but wait to get it from the library. Don't waste your money on this.

Customer review from the Amazon Vine&amp;#8482; Program (What's this?)
      
Pros 
1) ummm.......Looks nice 
Cons : Pretty much what has been said before 
1) NO ENDNOTE SUPPORT (and in the absence of VBA, likely never to get endnote support in the near future) 
2) Very slow in start-up! 
3) Pricey, very pricey for what you get 
The only solution for academic users I suggest is to install and use "Bookends" by Sonny software, which they have had to use a scripts workaround to work with office 2008, but AT LEAST IT WORKS! (I've found bookends to be superior to endnote anyways) 
In summary, $400US for a facelift is a bit pricey...
I think it is time for both Apple and Microsoft to get back to basics and address flaws in their software: pre-Intel the situation was far superior.

If you want to watch video more than 60 seconds or so.
First, do yourself a favor and try to find the creative lab phone support number on their website.   Back yet?  didn't find it did you?
Second, go to the creative lab forums and search on video and sync.  You'll find dozens and dozens of posts from people that watch video where the audio looses sync.  You'll find no answers on how to fix this.  You'll find suggestions about changing frame rate and bit rate and such (all of which require you buy and use a 3rd party conversion tool since the creative tool won't allow this)
1 month, 6 emails, 4 phone calls (eventually found their phone number from another source).   They can't fix the problem (I have a degree is software engineering and work in development of consumer electronic, so whether this carries any weight with you or not, I am not an idiot when it comes to troubleshooting)
They refuse to refund my money.  They RMA's a new unit with the same trouble AND a button which is faulty.  Now I can pay shipping again to get another device which will probably not work.  They also refused to put one of my videos from the return unit on the new device so see if it worked before they returned it!
I won't be buying another creative product...  Or at least I'll only buy it locally, test the hell out of it, and decide to keep or return withing 30 days.

If you are looking for a movie with recycled plots (no pun intended), endless and banal cliches,and commonplace animation styles, then Wall-E is your movie.  
A far cry from original and engaging works such as Ratatioulle, Shrek (pt. 1),and Beowulf.   Unlike most international films which are made by artists with integrity, Hollywood is more concerned with selling tickets to an undiscerning market.  How else can you explain the farce of three pirates of the Caribbean movies which become progressively worse, but sell more tickets with each subsequent release.  
Time to demand more from Hollywood. Vote with your pocketbooks and make them come up with better stuff. 
Looking at all of the 5 star ratings I am very ambivalent!  Hopefully this is a wake up call.

The keyboard on the Asus 1000 received today is abysmal. The whole keyboard sinks with each keystroke. It feels like the keyboard underlay is made of cardboard. I immediately repackaged the computer and sought the reseller's instructions for return.
Please note that I have NEVER sent anything back to an internet seller. It's too much hassle. 
This product, however, failed to come close to it's stated purpose (typing), and I will go through the time and effort of seeking recourse.
This might have been a 'first batch' product, in which case I will gladly wait for a replacement. I have gone so far as to suggest to the Amazon reseller that if the Linux product has a better keyboard, I would pay any increase in cost (within reason) and order it.
The reseller's name has been withheld, and I hope this purchase has a 'happy ending'.

It's unfortunate that I have to post a negative review on this product as I have used many other Linksys products in the past, and they have all been great.
However this particular router, which I purchased about 1 month ago, appears to be a major exception. My router was a version 5 router, and was delivered with version 1.00.0 firmware. As a former electrical engineer, with 20+ years in the PC industry I know it is never a good thing to get the first version of anything. Nevertheless I pressed on.
Installation is supposed be done using their super installation CD, (which I dislike intensely, as I like to know what the "experts" are doing to my system). Nevertheless, I tried the CD. It is supposed to help the wireless neophyte install a secure system. As expected, it bombed halfway through the install. I cleaned my system, downloaded the real user manual from the Lynksys website, and proceeded to install the router.
It worked great! Range was fantastic and all was well. The security was easy to set up if you knew what you were doing. (Several internet sites will describe this process step by step, and it seems that even the most elementary security will be better than what most people use as I found 2 unsecured wireless networks from my own living room).
However, after about a day, and then almost every day or two the router would lose its connection with my broadband cable network. FWIW, I'm on Optonline, have a stable PC running XP-Pro and use a Motorola Surfboard SB4100 as a cable modem. As 4 other PC's were also connected to the network, I would find out pretty fast when the connection was dropped. The only solution was a hardware reset.
I spoke with India 3 times in pursuit of a solution. They tried everything including a firmware upgrade, and a disabling of most protocols that had worked for 5+ years with my old dependable Linksys BEFSR41 Router. (One even suggested that I might have been better off if I could find a Version 4 router) I finally got through to a Cisco technical support rep in NY who suggested another bios update and then closed my "issue".
The connection would now go for a few days before dropping, when I finally took the advice of a friend, (with a Netgear wireless router with similar problems), and converted the router to a Wireless Access Point, WAP. I reinstalled my old trusty BEFSR41 as the main router for the cable modem, and disabled DHCP in the WRT54G - You will need to set up a static IP address for the wireless router that's different from the normal 192.168.1.1 and change where the DHCP starts to number the dynamic addresses.
It's been running without a glitch for 2 weeks now. As I bought it from Amazon, and had already processed a rebate claim, I thought it would be better to do this than try for a swap and return. Prospective buyers should check the latest bios and beware.

I purchased this product for my HP laptop, which uses Windows Vista.  I couldn't get it to open or install, so I went onto the Norton website and started a Live Chat session.  My support person couldn't get it to work either, so they just downloaded the program from their website.  We finally got it installed, after several hours.  The whole reason I ordered a CD rather than an internet download was so I would have the CD in case something happened to my laptop, (it crashed about 6 months ago and the whole hard drive had to be replaced).  The product itself is OK, but it was annoying to waste so much time and energy when it should have just installed automatically.

I have been a Turbo Tax user since '91.  I have become annoyed by the multiple deceptive and confusing versions they have released over the past couple of years.

The screwup that Intuit did this year with Turbo Tax (decepetive versions, significant crippling of product, plus price increase), has finally convinced me that it is time to switch to Tax Cut.
Intuit needs to eliminate it's current marketing dept and start fresh and go back to it's roots of delivering great reliable products that help their customers.

Battlestar Galactica is, by far, the best current show on television.  Season four is great. Others have commented on the content.
I am incensed, however, that they have once again decided to make us pay twice for a single season by doing the silliness of breaking the season into a 4.0 and 4.5, and charging full price for each.  They did this for season two, people complained, and they returned to sensibility for the season three single package.
I will purchase season 4 when it is complete, and for a price that is fair for one season, not two.  If it is not released this way, then I guess I'll have to wait a few years until it is readily available used or at fire sales.

I was so excited to finally get a sound machine, after a coworker of mine had been talking up her own and saying how great it was for restful sleep.
This machine has six functions, and after testing out each one, I found that they all seem to be a 30 second sound clip that merely repeats itself over and over and over throughout the night.  Something about hearing the same exact seagull squawk in the ocean sound every 30 seconds drove me nuts! I had to turn it off because I just could not get relaxed.
You're better off buying $20 of relaxation songs off iTunes and playing them through your iPod than buying this machine.  At least then, you can pick what sound you want to listen to, and it'll be much better composed and more random - allowing for better relaxation - than the machine's sounds.

Here are my impressions of this sad, sad "book":
1.  Edward &amp; Bella's relationship - This was the biggest disappointment in the book.  All romance completely and utterly vanished.  This book pretty much ruined their romance for me. 
2.  Different tone - The book had a completely different tone from the previous three.  It didn't even feel like the same author/series.  What replaced the exhilarating, somewhat innocent romance was disgusting and disturbing (i.e. the pregnancy, birth, transformation, imprinting on Renesme, etc.)  I found myself literally gagging at some parts.  Don't know how they'll make THIS one into a movie!  Actually, a movie could be a good thing.  The writer could completely change every dumb thing that Meyer did and fix the story!
3.  Inconsistent Characters - This is kind of like #2.  None of the characters (with the exception of Jacob) were anything like their former, lively, loveable selves.  They were mere shadows of what they'd been in the past.   I could go on and on on this one, but it would take too long to go through every character.  I'll get to a couple of the main ones.
4.  Edward -  He was a mopey, brooding non-factor for 95% of the book completely devoid of charisma, charm, and personality.  At one particularly low moment, he even suggests that Bella can fornicate with JACOB just so she can have babies!!!!!!!!  WHAT?!?!?!   I had less love for Edward after this book for sure.
5.  The Wedding - My wedding was better than Bella's, and she had endless money, vampire talents, and a writer's imagination and creativity to work with! 
6.  The Sex - OK, so it's a young adult book (although I don't really think a lot of the material IS suitable for young adults in this one)... I get the whole "fade to black" thing.  But, afterward, did Bella really have to turn into a whiney, sniveling twit, begging for it????
7.  Disappearance of the Cullens - They were barely in this book at all, except for Rosalie's disturbing, overbearing protection of Bella's stomach.  I don't think Esme had one sentence to say the whole time.  I couldn't believe how little Alice was involved in the book.  She was one of the best characters in the other three.  How could Meyer just abandon her?  And the whole thing where she leaves Bella a "clue" about her disappearance in a book... Gimme a break. 
8.  Pregnancy - Really dumb plot line.  I can't even believe she went there.  Not only is it gross, but pretty implausible considering he's a VAMPIRE.  Do they have super-sperm now, too?
9.  Renesme Carlie -  Need I say more?
10.  Jacob The Pedophile - I don't care how she "cleverly" set this up by making Quil imprint on a little kid and trying to explain that away.  It is still really disturbing and dumb... and, oh, a little too convenient that he imprinted on Renesme.  He was the only character whose "voice" didn't change, which was nice, but I really am offended at the way Meyer resolved his character.  He deserved way more after the way Bella figuratively kicked the crap out of him for two books.
11.  Bella's Anticlimactic Transformation - For three books we've been told how painful, how awful the transformation is.  We were told how difficult it is to be a newborn vampire, and how a person loses himself/herself for a while.  Now, granted that Meyer unsubtlely set Bella up to practically not be a human in the first place, since she obviously didn't fit in with humanity for many reasons, but still... it was all so easy!  The pain was barely mentioned, and practically from the first second she "woke up," she was THE perfect "vegetarian" vampire.  Not even a struggle!  What a joke!
12.  Charlie - I don't even know where to start with this one.  He's perfectly fine with the existence of werewolves and the knowledge that his daughter is obviously not the same as she was AND that he has a granddaughter already who ages at an insane rate........ as long as you don't give him any details.  Ignorance is bliss, I guess.  So convenient that he can still be in Bella's life now.
13.  Renee - I guess Bella didn't need to freak out about what her mother would think about getting married as a teenager.  Oh yeah, did I mention that Bella got married as a teenager?  I thought we were in Washington, not the deep South.
14.  New Cast of Characters - Some of the "vampire army" that assembled at the Cullen house was interesting.  But there were so many of them!  Meyer just kept piling them on.  They ended up not even being necessary and just watered-down the plot.
15.  The Non-Battle w/the Volturi - The battle was getting a little tense until the Volturi completely backed down like a bunch of...   kitty cats.  These Volturi don't seem so scary to me anymore.  After all, they didn't kill Edward, Bella, and Alice in Volterra (without much of a struggle or argument at all, mind you) and they took their sweet time to check out the Seattle vampires in Eclipse.  Really, it just seemed like all you had to do was "wink, wink" at Aro, and he'd let you slide.
16.  Bella the Non-Heroine - This one has two parts:
A) It would have been a little more redeeming if Bella had saved them all with her shield.  At least then she would have some point in the book.  But she didn't!  It was Alice who rushes in from who-knows-where with some ridiculous explanation about finding other vamps like Renesme who saves the day.  Really convenient that Meyer made up these new beings at the precise moment that she needed them.  Let's write a book and just make crap up from out of the blue AT the climax to save all our characters.  No one important died, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but would add depth/credibility to the overall struggle in the book.
B)   Bella doesn't have to sacrifice anything.  In the end, she gets everything she wants, all tied up with a neat little bow.  She doesn't have to give up being a mother to be with Edward (which was a big deal in Eclipse).  She suddenly wants to be married, go to college, have kids, etc.  She doesn't have to give up her soul, because apparently no one really cared about that anymore or mentioned it much in the book.  She doesn't have to give up Charlie.  She doesn't give two thoughts about what she'll do about Renee, so I guess she doesn't care.  She doesn't have to hurt Jacob anymore because he magically doesn't love her.  She doesn't have to struggle with Edward over the notion of her becoming a vampire... he doesn't have a choice in the matter--she'll die if she doesn't become one.  She doesn't have to go through any pain, suffering, or uncertainty when she becomes a newborn vampire.   She doesn't have to worry about the Volturi.  Bella had so much potential to be a great character.  Meyer just completely blew it.
17.  The Werewolves Aren't Werewolves - Oh yeah, did we forget to mention that they're actually NOT werewolves?  They're actually shapeshifters, so, yeah... no problem.
18.  The Writing Blows - In Meyer's defense, it always did.  There are a myriad of technical reasons I could get into about why Meyer is a terrible writer, but they're really moot at this point.  This book lacked what the other three did to make up for it: wit, interesting characters, love, and charm. 
Some people are annoyed by the way Bella gets married and has a kid young and that the ending is happy.  There are also a lot of sexist notions in the book, but I won't go into that here, and I'm usually not bothered by that kind of thing in general.  I don't really mind the ending either, I just wished some of the above had been different.  Thank goodness for the movie... It got me back into the series.  But I'll probably never read Breaking Dawn again.  I'll just pretend it ended with Eclipse and imagine my own ending.  It's sure as sh** better than what Meyer came up with!  What a cash cow!  She should be ashamed!
On a side note, there is another book called Midnight Sun, that retells Twilight from Edward's point of view.  She wrote about 250 pages of it and then it somehow got leaked on the internet.  She says she's so heartbroken and destroyed over it that she won't finish it or publish it now.  I think that's B.S.  I think she's so sick over how bad Breaking Dawn is and how so many people slam it and hate it and how she ruined the series, that she's chicken to finish Midnight Sun.  Cop-out.

I'm sure under the right circumstances this is a great product.  In fact, I use a Linksys wireless router at home with a Linksys cable modem and have never had any problems.
HOWEVER: If you use AT&amp;T DSL, this product ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY DOES NOT WORK with a Siemens SpeedStream 4100 DSL modem.  AT&amp;T does not give you the option of using any modem but the one they send you so do yourself a favor and try a web search using the name of your modem and the name of the router you are thinking of purchasing to find any compatibility issues.

My last diffuser worked great and then after a few months stopped.  I bought this one as a replacement but it seems as though after nearly 4 weeks my cat is still spraying and acting out.  I'm going to try using the feliway spray as well and see if the result puts the cat back on track &amp; problem free.
This product was once very effective but did not last long.  Its great when it works and a nightmare when it doesn't.  At about $20 a diffuser and $20 each month for the feliway the costs add up.

This is absolutely the worst software product I've bought!!!!  I purchased QB PRO 2009 for the first time 3 weeks ago.  This is a new installation, not an upgrade, on a brand-new computer.  I've had nothing but trouble.  The first occurred trying to set-up the company file.  Tech support wanted to charge me $79 to figure out their problem, but did not charge me when they determine that it WAS a software problem, not my computer.  Today, I tried to open the software and received an error message about the "qbregistration.dat" file.  14 hours later, I still cannot open QB, I've been through every bit of the online community and software knowledge suggestions, I even talked with a peon in tech support who could only resend me the software knowledge suggestions.  Obviously, there is a SERIOUS problem with their software, but Intuit will not investigate the problem until I pay them another $79.  They will not even look to see if the problem is on their end or my end.  At least Peachtree offers 30 days free tech support!!!!  I will be returning this product and buying Peachtree tomorrow.  I strongly advise anyone considering QB to rethink that decision.  Truly, 1 star was too high praise, I just had to pick something.  If I had my way, I would not have picked even one star.

I read the reviews here and don't agree with most of them.  I'm a very technical, IT sort of person who just wants stuff to work.  I don't update the firmware or do anything crazy, just work and this device doesn't seem to do that.  It started when the device kept dropping wireless connections like my xbox360 and tivo and my laptop that I use to vpn into work.  I called Motorola, they had me run some diagnostics and agreed to take the modem back.  I was sent a new device.  It worked flawlessly for a couple of months (like the last one) and now it's not dropping wireless connections but seems to just stop working.  All lights are lit solid and I have to reboot it to get it to working order, at times, I can't even get into the web interface and have to unplug it.  My ISP is Comcast and I live in MA.  I'll be looking for a new device this weekend to at least handle the routing and try to keep this device just for the modem.
UPDATE 1/31/2009:  I purchased an Apple Airport Extreme and turned everything on the SBG900 off to pretty much turn it into a modem only, hooked everything back up and now I have zero issues, more than twice the bandwidth and signal strength.  Devices that listed 54 mbps and 2-3 bars are now 130 mbps and 4 solid bars.  This clearly tells me that this product works flawlessly as a modem, but has serious issues as both.

I very much appreciate the concepts and ideas behind "The Secret".  The idea that one has control over their own destiny and personal power is an extremely important shift in thinking.  However, I was very disappointed in the materialistic, self-serving bent stressed by "The Secret".  It focused on individual material gain, with no mention of one's responsibility to improving the world.  I also found the racial dynamics of the film disturbing.  Far from being universal, "The Secret" specifically targets the white middle class audience.  "The Secret" also privileges white men, almost exclusively, with being the historical holders of 'the secret', while implying that others have suffered because they have never figured 'it' out, and don't know any better.  These undercurrents are too blatant to ignore.  So, if you do purchase this film, be aware of the implications.  Other materials, such as works by Louise Hay, and Gary Zukav, or books like "Ask and it is Given", certainly give the same message with a more balanced, compassionate approach.

Unless you're an expert with setting up wireless routers, I implore you to not buy this. I have done everything regarding following the instructions, however it's still no use. I have seen professionals from Comcast and Cox cable come in and somehow magically get theirs (just like mine) to work without following any of the instructions that come with the product either. I don't know what that's about, but it's annoying.  I can't keep spending two hundred dollars to have someone set this up everytime I move. The instructions that it came with should be good enough, but they are absolutely useless. I've wasted five hours one afternoon just trying to get this thing working. I'm not a computer novice either, which tells me you seriously have to be an expert, like working for the cable companies.  
Now I'm just going to buy a Linxys and pitch this P.O.S.  More waste for the damn landfill...ugh.

I'm on my 2nd Netgear router. Our first one had the nasty habit of dropping the connection when using a variety of programs. With the only solution being power cycling the router, my roommates and I found ourselves frequently running back to the living room to restart the router, usually several times a day. We eventually took the router, smashed it to bits with a hammer, and replaced it with a better product for $20 less.
I've moved into another home which also uses a Netgear router (provided by our ISP) and it's the same story. Within the last hour I've had to reset it 4 times, and I've had it. I came here looking for any information on how to fix the problem, only to find a slew of people with the same problem on SEVERAL Netgear routers.
I'm calling my ISP tomorrow to have them use a different brand of product, because I simply refuse to use another Netgear product. I don't understand how major problems like this can get by Quality Assurance on several products and still aren't fixed after a long time.
Save yourself time, frustration and money by not purchasing a Netgear router.

I purchased this as a physician to dictate directly into my office's EMR, but quickly discovered Nuance has disabled this feature with version 10. Version 9 Preferred would work in EMR's. Sure, they have a significantly more expensive "medical" version - in the $1400 range, but for essentially the same thing. The basic architecture for the program is identical, just an expanded medical database. Is that really worth another $1200? An online message board for my EMR is full of frustrated comments from other doctors who've been stung by this quirk from Nuance. Unfortunately for Nuance, they may have violated anti-trust laws by doing this. I agree with the above reviews as well, the installation process is severely flawed. Simply said, don't waste your time and money with version 10. I'm returning my purchase and going back to version 9.

I bought this item when I first got back into running to help keep up with how far I was going.  I have used it both outside and on a treadmill.  It only has one setting for stride.  My stride is different for a leisurely stroll, walking for exercise and jogging or running.  I wore my pedometer on the treadmill.  It was accurate for the leisurely stroll.  It was off by 1/2 mile for vigorous walking.  It was off over a mile when I jogged 3 miles.  It even misses steps.  Several days in a row, I ran on the treadmill, the same speed, the same distance, and the same time.  The step counter read vastly different several days in a row.  Needless to say, I have been dissappointed and am looking for a new product.  Any suggestions?

Now TurboTax 2008 will charge you $9.95 to print more than one tax return!! And the SAME (Bad Name 2) at Intuit have taken GIANT steps backwards with QuickBooks 2009.
WHAT THE HECK IS WRONG WITH INTUIT.
Looks like I'm going to have to go back to TaxCut this year, and give a serious look at SWITCHING TO PEACHTREE for my Accounting needs.
I've already decided NEVER to buy another GM automobile (after my 98 GrandPrix GTP spontaneously started an ENGINE FIRE - a KNOWN defect with NO RECALL WARNING).  This is AT LEAST the second time we've been HOSED by Intuit - - time to THROW the BA-----S OUT.
So how do I REALLY feel??  :-)

I have done alot of workout DVDs, and this one is definitely tough - especially the arm workout.  However, as some of the other reviews mention, there are literally no cues or explanations of how to properly do the exercises.

I suspect most of these reviews were written shortly after buying the product. But god forbid 6 months down the line you install another card into your network.
I bought all netgear stuff (router, PC card and PCMCIA card) to satisfy networking needs, so there would not be any issue about "oh you gotta call linksys for that problem" type of thing). I swear these guys put in code to make it stop working when the warranty is up. I know it sounds conspiratorial, but for 3 items this happens? come on!
First the router, looks nice. But why are the download speeds a fraction of the speed of the wireless connections? Can't get that question answered becuase my warranty is up even though these miserable speeds only came about when i installed the new cards.
I install a PCMCIA card on a laptop. Works good, but now my PC with a wireless card in it failed...guess what.. my warranty is up on that card too. It fails just when i install the laptop card? and i cant get help on that, becuase (everyone say it....): my warranty is up.
Knowledge base help is useless, ask anyone. email support is slow and they just give you canned answers which is useless. Netgear has truly terrible technical support, and it would be nice to see a company treat their customers in a way that would make them want to buy their products in the future. I know I wont be buying any more netgear stuff.
Buy equipment from a reliable company. Linksys (why did I switch? Why oh why?).

No.  It is too loud to use near human habitation, and it is too loud for the cats to bother approaching it for a drink.  And as someone observed here, it fills with junk and clogs in a heartbeat.

This little gadget got my teeth and gums cleaner than I ever thought possible. There was just one drawback--it was making my gums recede! Used it for 2 weeks, 2 or 3 times a day or more (the fresh clean feeling got quite addictive). I actually felt better. I had gingivitus and slight periodontitis. But soon my teeth were getting quite sensitive and to my horror I realized it was indeed destoying my gums. It says in the instructions to talk to your dentist first before using if you have gum desease which I have not, perhaps he will know if its possible to use safely. It also says to not touch the tip directly to your gums, indeed, as far away as possible but this is difficult since then its harder to keep the mouth completely shut &amp; water sprays out. And you can't see what you're doing either since your mouth is closed. Anyway since using I have learned how important it is to keep ones mouth clean--plaque forms at the tooth gum boundary 20 minutes after eating &amp; the bacteria double every hour and enter into your bloodstream through the gums and cause all kinds of problems.

I've had this appliance since just before Thanksgiving but only able to fully use it twice.  
It's very cool the way the egg poacher works with the muffin toaster. BUT when I washed the egg poacher cup, a good bit of teflon came off. (I tried a second time and my poached egg was full of black teflon flakes.)  The appliance came with a notice that implored you to please call the Back to Basics if there is a problem (rather than the retailer) so I did.
I was told they would send a replacement cup immediately. 
I can boil eggs in it which is great but you can't toast at the same time so either your toast or your eggs get cold while waiting for the other.  
As I approached my 30 day return period, I called back and was told that the cups were being redesigned and they would send one out immediately.
Today (now 64 days after the first call) I called again and was told that my cup was mailed 10 days ago (but only 7 business days so they won't even discuss tracing or resending until next week).  They mailed it from Utah.  I live in Seattle. 
I am so not happy with their service, their attitude and now I'm even getting annoyed at the appliance.  Hopefully, no one else will have this problem.  But, just in case...

Borrowed this camera from a friend to compare to my 3-year-old HDV-based Sony. Here's what I found:
1- Shoots great HD. Easy to use and very functional.
2- Plugs into my intel-based iMac via usb. Transfers easily, but TWICE as slowly as from my Sony.
3- Since the format is being converted to allow the files to play nice with iMovie, the end result is that the AVCHD is dumbed down a bit, just as with HDV. Side by side comparison of the final product (DVDs made in iDVD) is that they both end up looking just about the same.
So, I'm sticking with my antique HDV tape-based rig and waiting for someone to come out with a consumer HD camera that creates a format compatible with Quicktime without having to modify the files.
Are you listening Canon? Make a camera that allows me (and everyone else) to drag and drop the digital files into iMovie or FCP and i'll be first in line to buy it!!

I'd wanted to see the movie for some time now and was given the book as a gift. The book itself was pretty good but was so descriptive it ruined the movie for me. I finished the book on Sunday and decided to rent instead of buying the movie on Wednesday. I was excited to see the movie but was instantly disappoint. It deviated from the book a little which was fine but the story seemed to go so fast; trying to fit as much into an hour and a half as possible. I'm a fan of all of the actresses d absolutely loved the acting of Sophie Okonedo, who played the part of sister May. All in all the movie was both over and under-acted. 
I don't know if I would have liked the movie had I not read the book. There were heartwarming moments and I shed a tear or two but all in all I'm glad I didn't purchase the movie. I actually could have waited until it aired o cable.

I purchased this router without reading reviews on Amazon or other websites. As a result, I have been through a time consuming nightmare. I was diligent and meticulous in  following  the installation instructions out of the box.  Regardless, my computer's browser did not interface with the router. I called customer support and they told me I needed to download "new firmware" for the product. This is mind boggling. Why should I have to go through the process of downloading "new firmware" for a "new router"? Maybe I am missing something here but shouldn't the "new router" have workable "firmware" out of the box?  I am an attorney not a computer scientist.  What the heck is "firmware" anyway??  For the next 2 hours,  I was on the phone with customer support downloading and extracting zip files, cutting and pasting files into the address bar, opening and closing multiple windows, dragging and dropping files,  going into dos prompt, doing ipconfig, pingable ip etc. For an average user to run this crazy gauntlet of  complicated networking &amp; computer science is too much.  I am a busy professional and don't have time for crazy games in data communications. I need to turn the key and get going.   
After downloading and installing the "firmware"  and spending hours on the phone my computer and laptop were finally up and running.  I thought fantastic. I can finally get some work done.  I did some work and accessed a couple of legal sites.  The next day I am in an important meeting and need to access some files. My laptop is not connecting to the internet. I go into the next room and jump on my desktop. I can access the Internet but things are acting funny.  Web pages load slowly and  I can't access some sites (i.e. amazon.com).   Sometimes I can't type text into the URL address bar and when I do it won't delete.  In short, my entire system started acting very strange. I  called LinkSys back and they told me that the new firmware installed the previous day became "corrupt".  "How can that be?" I asked.  I didn't do anything to it.  The LinkSys rep. responded that he didn't know and that we would have to go through the process again. No sir, we will not be going through the process again.  
 
I am returning the router to Best Buy for an exchange and will not get a LinkSys.  If  Best Buy does not take back the router then we will all meet in court for: false advertising breach of contract, consumer fraud, punitive damages, loss of  fiduciary productivity. I can think of many other things to talk about. I might get a 100K out of the whole thing!  I'm ready to fight these LinkSys (...)

After reading all of these reviews I ran to my local BJ's wholesale and bought my first Keurig......It was defective.  It vibrated my mug off of it made horrible noises and even worse made terrible weak coffee.  So I took a break.  For mothers day my husband bought me the Keurig B60 to replace my existing Senseo.  The machine does not viberate like the last nor does it make horrible noises but the coffee is still not very good (I tried the variety pack or at least 8 of them.)
On the other hand my Senseo broke after 1 1/2 I called customer service and without any questions they sent me a replacement Senseo and free return shipping.  The coffee tastes 1000 times better also (medium and dark roast mainly the flavored ones not so great).   
It is funny because my family and friends all think I hate strong coffee but the Keurig seems weak to me on the smallest cup setting while using the darkest roasts.
I love my coffee but the Senseo pods (used to be $3.85 not $4.10 at walmart) are twice as cheap, have better customer service (from reviews), and ultimately taste better for less then $70 without a coupon which you can find almost anywhere (e-bay, craigslist etc)  The keurig does look pretty at least while the Senseo just looks like it belongs...at least in my kitchen.

I have had trouble with several sanas products.  Though their mp3 players are inexpensive and inoative, in the end you get what you pay for.  A product that doesn't last and poor customer service.  Just try gettint though to them to fix a product.  They count on you just giving up becuase it isn't worth the trouble.  When you buy a cheap product like a sansa, you expect them to be thow away, but when they break in a month, it really pisses you off.  I have thrown away three different sansa mp3 players that lasted less than three months.  It just wasn't worth the trouble to try to deal with customer service.

I used Turbotax to do my taxes for several years only to find out that it was calculating my taxes incorrectly and I owed thousands more.  Years later I am still trying to pay it off.  And because of their stringent rules that require you to register and report it within 30 days and even if I satisfied that they'll only pay the initial penalties and interest.  Would of been better off doing my taxes without the software.

I bought this product so my cat would have cleaner/fresher water to drink instead of the standard bowl of water. I work long hours and not intentional I'd forget to change her water bowl everyday. Her water bowl after about 2 days would be dirty with food and slimey. The machine is bulky and noisy. I've never seen her use it, the equipment still gets slimey, however there isn't any food in it, so I don't think she is using it. Unless I'm doing something wrong, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!

I really wanted a product like this, however it doesn't work. I took it out of the box and charged it up. It kept shutting off before being fully charged. it took four attempts to get it charged.
When i turned it on it either freezes or shows a screen full of static. no image. have to hold the power button down to shut down. even a reset (paper clip in the reset hole) doesn't make it better.
this is really a piece of garbage and it's only backed by a 90 day warranty. I suggest you stay away from this one.

I was excited about this new router, thinking that with the two large antennas, it would give great range.  Unfortunately I still have not been able to test the range.  For starters, the power cord was dead on arrival.  After searching for about a half an hour, I was finally able to find a phone number for support.  After three different phone calls, and being transferred to numerous different people and long hold times, I gave up on getting a new power cord and scavenged one from an old router I had.  Once I was able to power-up, I connected to the router via wires no problem,however, I was unable to get the wireless side to work.  After two more calls to customer service and over 2 hours of trying to talk it through with them, I was told that my only option would be to pay $9.99 so tech support could log onto my computer to try and fix the problem.  At that point I decided that it just wasn't worth it to keep throwing good time and money at this problem.  In reality the only option I had left was to send the router back.  
I realize that sometimes products are defective and I don't judge linksys  negatively for what may have been an isolated incident.  However, there is no way that the incredibly poor and useless customer support that I received was isolated.

Remember when Microsoft told us that Vista was so much better than XP and 2000, but those who bought it discovered that even though everything was much prettier, it took them twice the amount of time to do basic things they could do before? It seems that Intuit is doing the exact same thing. 
I was a very, very happy user of Quicken Home and Business 2006. In fact, I have been a happy user of Quicken since it was sold on 5 1/4" disks for the Apple II. 
Intuit started telling me that automatic downloads from financial institutions would no longer work, and that I had to upgrade to 2009 in order to keep that feature. Being a computer programmer, I know this is a lot of bull. What happened was, someone in the marketing department discovered that people weren't buying 2009. So what do they do? Planned obsolecence. Start disabling perfectly good features in 2006 so that everyone needs to fork over $80 to buy the new version. 
I happily forked over the money. After all, like I said, I was perfectly happy with 2006, and I figured that 2009 would be an improvement.
I had always been very happy with Quicken's user interface. The problem is, it seems that since 2006 it seems that they fired all their UI people. The new software is "pretty". It's got "round edges" like modern software is supposed to have. 
But just one small example. The accounts list on the left of the screen can't be resized past 242 pixels. So if I have an account that reads "American Express - Starwoods Preferred Card", it now reads "American Express - Starwoo". Yes, I can rename the account, but why should I? In 2006, I could resize the panel just fine, thank you very much.
Another thing that boggles my mind. There is a 2-pixel vertical line to the left of that screen. It took me about 10 minutes to realize this is supposed to be a scroll bar. I am no UI expert, but this breaks every single usability rule in the book. In 2006, there was a perfectly fine traditional scrollbar. But some idiot designer decided along the lines that usability wasn't as important as keeping the beautiful rounded corners pretty. 
This is just talking about two little features. Multiply this by about 200, and you'll know the frustration you'll be facing when you install this. There are dozens and dozens of buttons that I'll never use, but now every time I open Quicken I'll have to navigate through them to do what I want. 
This is the kind of thing that happens when a company becomes a monopoly. They lose touch with what made them successful in the first place, and a bunch of hack executives try to "improve" their product, but end up destroying it because they don't try to understand what made it successful in the first place. In Quicken's case, it was simplicity, lack of bloat, a great user interface, and a product that worked. I hate to say it, but Intuit "jumped the shark" with this one. They dropped the ball with Turbotax, and now they're doing the same with this once-fine product.

When I first got this eeepc, I was very impressed with it.  Great portability, good boot time.  I didn't worry about the small keyboard, though it is inconvenient when trying to type out an angry review...pardon any typos.  The  problem comes when trying to watch videos.  The included mplayer is horrible.  My videos are slow and skip like mad.  At first I thought it was the laptop, but found out it was just a buggy player.  "No problem, I thought...I can download a different one."  I was referred by several people to VLC, and I thought it would be a simple act of downloading the program, double-clicking to install, and watching movies.  No.  FAR FROM IT.  In  order to install VLC, I had to go to an online chatroom to find a linux guru, who patiently coached me through the install process.  I had to open up a text file, add some ftp addresses to it, run some crazy linux code to download packages, update something, then install....it was like a programming language!  Finally, VLC worked for me....until this morning, when I saw that Firefox needed to be updated.  So I clicked on update, and now VLC no longerworks.  I went online to see that everyone else was having the same problem.  I can't even reverse the update, like I can with Windows.
I've had it.  I am now forced to purchase Windows XP and install it, if I can, JUST SO I CAN WATCH MOVIES ON MY EEEPC!!!!!  
I thought I was getting the good deal...a bigger SSD with Linux...no problem when all I'll do is get online, check email, and watch movies right?  WRONG!
Get the 16GB SSD with Windows XP, and buy a 4GB flash drive.  Linux is worthless to people like me who don't know how to use it.

I read the box over and over to make sure I understood what capabilities this drive had besides just being a large hard drive.  The data syncronization, backup and versioning capabilities were the biggest selling points for me. The device was touted as a 'Data Mover' rather than a drive.  I was very disappointed to find out that the software that does everything the box promises is a trial version.  Plan to spend another $30 if you want any of those capabilities.  It also seems cheap that an eSata cable is not included.  Otherwise, the drive is quiet, looks cool with the lighting and does not get as hot as other reviews have indicated.  The drive is good, but don't buy it for the Data Mover functions promised on the box.  The advertising seems very misleading.

I received this camera as a gift to record my son's 1st birthday. Out of the box, the camera was easy-to-use (as promised) for what is basically a flash drive with video software. The buttons, screen and menu actions are pretty straightforward. This is where the good stuff ends.
I hooked the camera up to my iMac. The camera was not recognized. I hooked it up to my Powerbook. The camera was not recognized.
I emailed support with a very specific description of what I had done and the machine setup. The first (clearly canned) response from support were instructions for Windows. Not helpful. I emailed back to say as much and they sent me instructions for Mac that did not work and they (again) ignored the crux of the problem. The camera is not recognized. In order to run the firmware update (which I'm guessing is supposed to fix everything), it has to be able to recognize the camera. Strike two for support.
Out of pure frustration, I plugged it into my PC laptop. The device is recognized, but when trying to run the firmware update, it errors out with an actual message that says to contact the manufacturer. Really?! The messed up part of this is that they actually thought about this error message, which means they knew this was going to happen in a fair amount of instances.
Overall, I'm not only disappointed, I'm frustrated and annoyed by their poor customer support. Clearly they have the marketing thing down ... how about providing some better customer support. Or at least reading customers emails before they respond to them. I'm returning this item with my son's 1st birthday video that I won't ever see. How sad is that? 
:: Update :: Customer service did replace my Flip and the replacement worked just fine. The only issue I've had since is a need (common to all external drive-type media) is to make sure you've emptied the trash if you've deleted videos from the device directly from your computer. After more use, the video quality isn't super high quality, but it is really useful for upload to video sites. It also doesn't handle movement well, but it's definitely worth it for what it is.

0 starts would be more appropriate.
Finally wanted to update from Quickbooks Pro 5 (Mac), and purchased the download version. 
After confirmation of purchase the download page resulted in a "File not found" message, no matter how I tried to access it. 
There was no option to report a problem! The only customer support was via phone for a fee of $39.-. Unwilling to pay this I cancelled my order and requested a refund - That seemed to work, but according to their website you have to do this within 45 min of purchase!!! It was hard to find. By the time I realized the problem, tried to contact customer service and found the hidden refund info, my time for requesting a refund was almost up!
I will stick with my reliable workhorse Quickbooks Pro 5 for Mac, and forego the improvements I had hoped for (Mac address book tie in. i.e.) At least this old version works.
Don't bother with the download version!

Let me start of by stating that this will be the first time I ever returned an item to Amazon.  Yes, I sometimes get product I am not satisfied with, but I usually give them away.  However, not this time, I will not let some poor soul get fooled by this inaccurate piece of ... plastic!  I would be afraid that someone might take these readings seriously and become anorexic.
Two trainers (sports medicine and nutritionist majors) measured me at the same time.  One was at 16.5% and the second at 18%.  I bought the Accu-Measure Fitness 3000 Personal Body Fat Tester and it measured 17.5%, heck even the Navy tape measure system measured 20.1%.  The Omron HBF-500 estimates 29%!  I read and reread the instructions and I keep getting 26% - 29%.  Yes I get these results seconds apart.  I do not expect it to be perfect, I am well aware of a 1-3 point variance between measurements but 11 points is ridiculous. Am I to believe that I am an "athlete" because it clearly states it does not work on athletes?  I am in good shape and I do exercise regularly.  However, I do not consider myself to be in the same class a triathlete or any pro athlete.   Does this only work on sedentary people?   
By the way it cant even get weight measurements right.  It varies up to 1.8lbs! I swear I try to stand on the exact same position and it still varies, it even varies more if I reposition it on the same surface.  So how do I know which is right.  I would not even mind if it was slightly inaccurate, but I do demand consistency.  How else am I to track progress?  One last rant.  The guy pictured on the box looks as if he is in ok shape.  Why does it work for him?

I was under the impression I'd be getting a viable means of measuring body fat with this device.  I'll be 50 years old at summer's end and have always worked out.  When I got my first measurements, I was shocked.  The unit indicated I had 25% body fat.  Caliper measurements, as well as those calculators wherein you enter height, weight, and a few tape measurements, always indicated results ranging from 12 - 18% body fat.  Vanity aside, it is obvious I work out as I have discernable muscularity, including 6-pack abs.  Standing 6 feet, weighing 175, and looking like I do, I really wondered if Omron could be accurate.  I contacted their support center and was informed that the unit is accurate for 2 out of 3 people and that it wasn't designed for athletes.  I'm not sure I understand why that would be so, but that is what they told me.  So, if you're already in decent shape, this may not be the product for you.

I purchased this Juicer based on the high rated reviews. Received it the next day and put it to work. I attempted to juice a few carrots, oranges and strawberries. It did ok on the carrots but it was literally throwing orange and strawberry pieces out of the feed chute. The motor is too powerful for it's own good and there's no option to switch to a lower speed. While the juice was pouring down to the plastic container, it splashed a lot, this is a design failure and I shouldnt have to put paper towels underneath. Contrary to all the people raving about easly clean up,  cleaning the parts is not that easly and rinsing under the sink will not get the pulp out from all the corners. The large mesh screen is difficult to clean using various brushes and it's fragile. All this juicer has going for itself is that it's powerful and fast and so what when it takes you forever to clean it's parts. I can juice and clean my old juicer in a much shorter amount of time. I have returned this juicer for a full refund. Extremely overrated product.

I'm disappointed by this product.  I was comparing it to the George Foreman models with removable grill plates, and I went with the Cuisinart model because it seemed like a better made product.
Cleaning the grills is a huge PITA.  My old george foreman grill had attached plates, but it wasn't as much of a hassle to clean.  I've tried soaking the plates, leaving wet paper towels on them after cooking, non stick spray...nothing makes the job easier.  Each pretty grill mark on the meat leaves a huge mess on the grill, and each raised metal grill portion has a 90 degree angle for food to get stuck in.  To clean it thoroughly, you need to go over each angle, then clean the tops, then the middle troughs.  It's very time consuming, and it makes me question whether the plates are actually coated with something nonstick.
I'm also diappointed by the depth of the grilling plates.  Liquid and fat pours over the edges easily.  It puddles by the griddler's feet, on the back side, and into the grill where the heating elements are.
I think this item is best suited for pancakes or grilling sandwiches.  It doesn't handle grilled meat or moist items very well.
I don't think I would re-purchase the item, because it takes way too long to clean it.  It makes it more of burden than a useful kitchen tool.

I'm not generally a fan of wireless controller, for one simple reason.  I don't need the wireless feature, and I'd prefer to not think about batteries.  However, I was not about to pass up the $20 after rebates price on this pad.
This button arrangement of this pad perfectly fits Madden 2005, enhancing gameplay immensely over other pads that may require you to remember what button correspond to what in the manual. (Madden 2005 allows you to configure your gamepad, but the configuration does not work for all phases of the game, e.g., the snap, and the receivers may be labelled differently than set up in Madden 2005's button configuration utility.)
True, the gamepad lacks Force-Feedback in Madden 2005 - so does every other game controller.  MADDEN 2005 PC DOES NOT SUPPORT FORCE-FEEDBACK FOR ANY GAMEPAD, PERIOD.  That's EASport's fault, not Logitech's.
For the person with the calibration problems after replacing batteries, try unplugging the receiver unit from the USB port and plugging it back in.
If you want to play Madden 2005, and have no intention of playing games with Force-Feedback, but by the non-Forceback version of this gamepad, unless you get a deal.  Similarly, unless you get a deal on this gamepad, or you really want or need wireless, get the wired version of this gamepad.

Once Upon a Time,
Alright... I'm actually a little lost as to what I should say to be honest.  I really loved Twilight.  I liked New Moon, I fell for Jacob and Edward in Eclipse.  Breaking Dawn was a disappointment.  If you are looking for a fairytale ending here you go.  Have at it.  If you are looking for the real truth of true love, of pain, of sacrifice, of life just don't read this book.
I repeat don't read this book.  Create your own ending, create your own pain and fantasy of the epic of Bella and Edward, of the sacrifice of Jacob.  For if you read this book you will be disgusted and creeped out a little on who Jacob imprints on.  
The plot was not as good as the first three books.  Bella did not grow up, she did not learn that anything worth having is hard to get and comes with a price.  Instead Meyer threw the pain and epic battles of the first three books out the window and implanted Bella with happiness and sparkles. 
I believe that every single reader expected differently of Meyer and I am sad to say she threw in the towel for this book.  It was as if she was so worried about pleasing everyone that she ended up pleasing no one.  Bella runs away with the entire cake and eats it too.  For all your fans who believe that this was a great book and ended perfectly I pity your lack of imagination and wish that Meyer treated us with another Twilight or another Host.

I purchased this camera as a replacement for my JVC GR-DVM70. I loved the idea of recording to solid state memory, and creating videos in high definition since I have two high definition tv sets.
What I have learned is, the video format AVCHD is just not supported yet. I purchased a game console to view the videos and that works well, but since I am the only one who has the game console I am the only person who can view my movies. :(. 
The software that comes with the camera is bare bones. It will not allow you to convert AVCHD to standard DVD except directly from the camera. The problem is, the video on the camera is not edited hence if you choose to do this, the dvd will have all the junk that you taped that you don't want to see. The software has edit capability, but it is not intuitive. And I edited a 30 minute movie to remove some footage, and it took 3 hours for the software to save the small edited file! Supposedly you can save the file back to the camera and then save the file from the camera to dvd. I tried this, but canceled the operation because of the time constraint. It takes 5 to 6 hours to do this for a 30 minute video.
The camera does not have an auto fade, the specs are wrong. It has semi-auto fade. While video taping, you need to press the joy stick to tell the camera to fade out when the pause button is pressed. Pressing the joystick while recording makes the camera shake and ruins the video. Another pet peeve is that the date and time can not be retained on the final video. And the stabilizer isn't very good once you zoom out to about 10X and beyond. And it has no view finder, for those bright sunny days. Also it insists on being plugged into the wall outlet when you hook it up to your PC.
The movies that this camera takes which I play on the ps3 in HD look no better than the video that my 8 year old JVC took. Go figure. No motor noise on the movies from the HF100 however.
The nice things about the camera are it's size, it is very portable and it records directly to solid state SDHC. It does a decent job of recording in low light. The still images it takes are decent.
I will take the gamble and continue to make my AVCHD movies and store them. Hopefully editors and blue ray players will be developed and be affordable so that I can share my movies one day.

I have had (and still have) several wireless routers from different companies.  This seemed to work OK until it stopped connecting to the internet (after maybe 6 months).  I tried an SMC which worked fine so I knew the problem was in this router.  I spent an hour on the phone with 2 "customer service" reps who just wanted to verify what the problem was over and over.  I was disconnected from the first (by accident or on purpose) after 25 minutes.  I called right back.  The second one diudn't even get their procedures right (I had just been through them 3 times) as he skipped necessary steps (Like telling me to open properties of the network connections icon in control panel rather thn opening it and going to the connection at issue.)  After 20 more minutes of this, I asked to speak to a supervisor.  He put me on hold for 7 minutes then came on and told me I would be transferred.  I got 3 rings -- then a dial tone.  Linksys seems to have farmed out customer support to a call center where the people are very hard to understand, where they seem to know nothing, and where they seem so inattentive that they lose track of where they are in their checklists.  I will never buy linksys again.  That's the only way to not have to deal with these folks since problems with the equipment arise with some frequency.

I bought an ipod touch 2nd generation with 32GB about 6 months ago.
My Ipod was working fine for 4 months and it was great while it did. Then it crashed and the sleep button and the volume up and down buttons malfunctioned. I sent the unit back and was told that they could find nothing wrong with it and shipped it back. It continued to have the same problem and than about a week later somehow started working correctly again. Now two months later the unit literally died right in front of my eyes while I was holding it at work. Only six months old! I sent the unit back and this time it was returned with a note saying "we regret we were unable to complete the service you requested due to one of the following conditions - a diagnostic evaluation has determined the ipod has internal damage related to a liquid spill or contamination". The unit was never exposed to any water or other fluid as I treated it with TLC complete with a skin and screen cover. The only way it could have had water damage was if there was condensation. However, this seems unlikely since I live in the desert southwest. Anyway, i called apple after receiving the letter and they could offer no help at all.
I have always been an early adopter of new technologies and guess I have just been lucky not have any issues with any of my electronic equipment. However, this series of events has frankly left me feeling very cheated. I had already bought an additional Iphone for my wife and another Ipod touch for an another family member. So far without issue. However, I wish I knew how apple treated its customer before hand! Never would have bought them.
As it stands, I had four people at work convinced that they needed to have an ipod touch prior to my experience. All of them have since reconsidered. Economic times are tough, to tough to throw $400.00 in the trash!

Product worked great at the beginning but after a very few times of poaching, the egg gets more and more runny until now it is almost like a raw egg even after putting more water than it calls for when poaching.  The next time I poach I will try putting the water up to the boiled eggs line and see if that will work.  It continues to steam some but it must not be hot enough.  I like the concept and I must have a defective egg poacher because the other reviews have not mentioned this problem.

There are a few things you should know. I have been using a pedometer for about 6 months now and recently "upgraded" to the slick 720 due to a great price discount. I love the features of past day's memory, ability to download to PC, aerobic counts, etc. However, it has some major problems. Here are my complaints:
* The size. This thing is pretty huge to wear around all day and is hardly inconspicuous.
* The stupid clip is just amazing it passed through initial product development. The clip falls off VERY easily and even more often the unit falls out of the clip. It happens just about every time I squat of bend over -- which is often if you walk with the dog and you have to toss a ball or pick up after them (which is extra unpleasant to suddenly have a piece of electronics attempting to dive into the pile of poo).
* The accuracy. This is the biggest problem of all as it's the main reason I have the thing! I have a digiwalker that counts very accurately without any of the features that I have used to compare with this one. The Omron is very accurate when you are on a walk, but it has a delay before it starts counting. If you continue walking it counts all the steps during that delay, but if you stop it ignores them all. Presumably this is to avoid counting accidental bumps in someone's bag or something, but when it's on your waist and you are just milling around the house, office, running errands, or what-have-you it will undercount by 50% or more. 
It's very, very frustrating. If you want to keep track of the steps only when you are going for a walk, then this unit is probably hard to beat. If you want to track your steps over a day and more or less constantly use the unit, there are more accurate, smaller units that you will be happier with (though you'll have to track, record, and reset the counter yourself).

This was my first convection toaster oven, and I must say that I was very impressed when I baked my first frozen pizza in it. It was the first time that any pizza came out with the crust crispy from a toaster oven that I had used!
CONS : Just note that it is sloped at the back so when you bake something, the back half will cook faster than what is at the front. So, you'll have to remember to turn the tray halfway through cooking. I've had pizzas and toast burnt on one side and be perfect on the other, so you'll definitely have to keep an eye on the stuff while it cooks.
It does get hot, but not more than most toaster ovens. I keep mine on a countertop with plenty of space around it.
When I got mine, it came new... but the door had trouble closing after I slid in the little bottom rack. Not a big deal, since I just bent the jams in the door a little and all is well.
Price. If I had to buy this at the price listed, I would not. Fortunately, I had two amazon vouchers, so I was able to take off $50 off the retail price and got it for about $20 with free shipping when it was all said and done.
I'm looking for another toaster oven now... will definitely get one that isn't sloped in the back where the heating elements will toast food up unevenly. That can be quite annoying!

I have used Turbotax for about 10 years and while there have been a few bugs, I have generally been satisfied.  No more.  This is the WORST EDITION OF TURBOTAX EVER.
There are problems with incomplete form input information,  printing problems (one inch of form missing from right side), problems with the program crashing (numerous times - and loosing ALL information).  Their website is of no help, and questions go unanswered.
I am concerned that there may be errors in the computation of the taxes - resulting in too much (or too little) tax owed.  These are the things that trigger audits and penalties. 
The programmers on this version were either asleep at the job or they all quit.  Either way, this program is a dog.
Skip this one and hire somebody to do your taxes, or get a different program.  This is a waste of money and time.

Problem with LaCie 1TB Neil Poulton hard disk (model 301315U with FW 400 &amp; eSATA connectors): I wrote to the Mikey Mouse LaCie Support &amp; asked twice about how to control the fan and twice they replied there was NO FAN in this model!
The casing is made of plastic so not good for heat dissipation and in a cool 20c (68F) room it overheats at 46c (115F) in it's normal horizontal position. Overheating shortens the hard disk life.
The internal fan never ran on USB or Firewire connections. Putting it in vertical position for better airflow dropped the temperature 9c (16F). The problem is that now I have ugly cables sticking in the air.
I then connected the drive using eSata &amp; curiously it unlocked the noisy fan somehow, now it's on ALL THE TIME even on Firewire &amp; modulates fan speed even if the drive runs only at 29c (84F) and never turns off.
I strongly suggest you download a utility to monitor your external hard disk temperature if you do not want to lose all your data from an overheating drive, the #1 cause of failing drives.
Do yourself a favor &amp; get the newer model made of aluminium &amp; standing vertical for much better self cooling properties: LaCie 301442U d2 Quadra Hard Disk 1TB eSATA/FireWire800/FireWire400/USB 2.0 External Hard Drive (Aluminum)

I've had the device now for about a month ... it holds about 4000 mp3's, ~10000 photos and a few movies. I've not used the video record feature but expect to soon. 
1-User interface is at a 'beta' stage and is not friendly or well thought out.
2-When playing audio it is not possible to leave the track selection menu and dig around looking for other tracks without stopping the music
3-You cannot connect the unit to a PC and the TV at the same time (you can physically but only 1 will work).
4-Others have reported that 2 PC's cannot connect via the network simultaneously... I've not tried this but it would not surprise me.
5-Comments about the remote being poor in terms of angle are correct - it's poor
6-There is no online administration (HTML/web interface). It must be administered via the TV.
7-The play list s/w that comes with the unit is lame at best ... VERY minimal functionality.
8-The poor documentation indicates that winamp can be used to create play lists but gives no clues as to how.
9-File xfr is limited to cifs and FTP ... (nfs or rsynch would be nice!)
10-no issues moving files although the largest I've moved is about 1.7GB
11-functions well as a secondary backup (NAS) as long as your happy with CIFS or FTP.
12-Iomega website is awkard to navigate
13-Support forums for this device are almost non-existent
14-Video playback formats are limited
For $250 it's not a bad little (limited) NAS but the promise on the box is unfulfilled!!

I'm old enough to have watched the original series and I enjoyed the campy "let' s not take ourselves to seriously" feel. The original had great actors Lorne Greene, Jane Seymour, Ray Milland (Pilot) to name a few. John Colicos was the ultimate villain, no angst with this guy. Not only was there an ensemble cast but each week cameo appearances by Fred Astaire, Lloyd Bridges and many others. One of my favorite characters was Colonel Tigh played by Terry Carter. So with excitement I watched this remake of a classic 70's show.
Imagine my horror when I saw this rubbish that seems to bear little resemblance to the original. I think the people behind this show had the original described to them without ever watching one episode. Each and every character has been changed for the sake of change. Adama was regal now militaristic. Can someone tell me why the blacks are gone? (I guess because blacks can't afford cable so who cares.) Starbuck was a bad boy womanizer but now is a female. So Apollo's wing man is female. The Starbuck character is the typical male warrior who is dysfunctional except in combat. A female in this role is hard to buy, since most dysfunctionals are male(see "The War Lover"). A could only stomach part of the pilot. I thought I was watching Melrose Place in space instead of a first rate Scifi. The characters seem flat and one dimensional. The worst part is how seriously this show takes itself. I don't really understand the popularity of this show. It is on the Scifi channel and can't have the audience (or Budget) of a CSI. Try to watch a couple episodes for free. Firefly is a decent show with an original concept(and at least it was on network TV). I would say don't waste your time or money unless you really like this kind of tripe.

This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)
      
After Twilight, I had hoped for a better sequel.   I compared the first book to Buffy and Angel, but the second is a much better comparison to the Olivia Hussey version of Romeo and Juliet.  (good job here Ms Meyer with recognizing that fact)   Funny, now in my mid forties, I struggle with watching those old films and how weak and dependant the women are portrayed.  (I'll take Clair Danes' Juliet anytime)
"New Moon" certainly satisfied my need to get through the series and figure out the ultimate answer-does Bella get turned.   I myself however, am much more partial to Joss Whedon's  "will Buffy and Angel ever do it again."  Joss was extremely careful to ensure Buffy remained strong and in control and a model of the women we all want to be.   Ms Meyer, instead chose to portray Bella like the sappy weepy side that we all have inside of us.  Like all women, I can certainly relate to that hopeless and helpless feeling that follows a break up.  But four months of near catatonia, be real.   Was Ms Meyer just appealing to that "Jerry Springer" mentality where masses of Americans have to watch those worse off than ourselves? 
I would be tempted to give this book 3 stars just because I did enjoy reading it and who wouldn't feel for the loyal Jacob.  (canine is certainly an apt symbol).   But my undeniable feminist side cannot believe that this is the type of literature our girls should be gaga over.   I really can't find any redeeming qualities with this book, other than the fact that I found it addictive.  Ms Meyers quick simple writing style makes it easy to stay engaged and complete the book on one cup of coffee.

THERE ARE SPOILERS CONTAINED IN THIS REVIEW. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
To be honest, I haven't even been able to bring myself to finish reading the book, though I do know what happens due to reading spoilers online. I'm just so horrified by what I've read so far that I need to take a break from it. It's corny and overly-contrived and has many "WTF" elements that make the novel seem like an elaborate fanfiction.
If you are young and idealistic, by all means, read this novel. It's clear that, generally speaking, only readers aged 12-14 could even hope to enjoy this novel - I should hope older readers would be mature enough to realize that the book is not good, and anyone younger shouldn't be reading it. I say "idealistic" because the novel very much goes in the "happy endings for all!" direction, which, based on the previous novels of the series, should have been impossible, thus making this novel the most extreme deux ex machina I've ever encountered.
I must warn away anyone that is even the least bit feminist. Throughout the series, Bella has always been a bit of a letdown for a lead female character: She allows Edward to control almost every aspect of her life, and is so dependent on him that it makes me ill. In this novel, the anti-feminism vibe is pushed even further, with Meyer not-so-subtly hinting that all a woman needs to be happy is a husband and babies. 
Meyer also conveys an anti-human vibe - by the end of the novel, pretty much all the central characters are some sort of supernatural species, and they all seem thrilled about the fact. It's disturbing, to say the least.
The entire novel was just such a huge disappointment. It completely negated one of the major themes of the series: choice. In Eclipse, Bella faces the choice between Edward and Jacob and, knowing what she will give up (Charlie and Renee, Jacob, the possibility of children, college, etc.), she chooses Edward. That extreme sacrifice was, I felt, the most defining characteristic of Edward and Bella's relationship. Breaking Dawn completely negates that sacrifice with the many deux ex machina plotlines Meyer introduces, which cheapens Edward and Bella's relationship, which, as we all know, was always the central aspect of the series.
I won't go into any more specifics, but I will say that there were just so many things in this novel that were completely outrageous. When I first read the spoilers, I didn't even believe them. Then when I started reading the novel, I was angry and upset. Now, I've joined the masses that are simply laughing at the novel - we laugh so we don't cry ;)
In conclusion: Read the book for laughs. Don't go in with any high expectations of any sort, because you will be severely disappointed.

I loved this coffee maker when I got it for Christmas 2007. I joined a coffee club and my k-cups were soon filling up my pantry closet. I loved it so much that I bought one for my daughter and her husband. Theirs stopped working altogether 8 months after they got it. Mine started acting up after 9 months, taking 10 minutes between brews for the water to heat up for the next cup. (Certainly not ideal when you have company.) I de-scaled, as instructed, and took very good care of the machine. But this morning, after it was done brewing a cup of coffee, I heard a loud "pop" and turned around to see flames shooting up behind it. The fire was out quickly, and no real damage was done, aside from a blown circuit breaker and outlet. The machine, however, is toast - after less than one year of use.  
Whie the machine was working, I thought the coffee was above average. But the reliabilty of this model is poor, and the workmanship VERY questionable. I doubt I'll be replacing this with another Keurig.

I received my airport express about 30 days ago.  It was an almost automatic set up and worked for the first 3 weeks.  The communication with the printer was always extremely slow from the get-go.  Recently, the device just quit communicating with the internet.  In order to re-establish internet contact, I had to unplug the device and then run the diagnostic process.  It always recovered (for a while) then lost internet after some period of time.  I contacted Apple support who was unaware (claimed) of the problem.  After 30+ minutes on hold, my connection was terminated.  I'm back to my Linksys and, (if afforded the opportunity), will get my money back from Apple and stay with Linksys.
The best I can say about this product is that it is "compact" and Apple tech support folks do speak english.

We've had the GOD, (Money), CHASERS, the PROMISE, (not to ever criticize), KEEPERS, Nicky Mumble's the ALPHA (without the Omega) COURSES, Pastor Ricky of the 'Flock that likes to Rock's the PURPOSE DRIVELLED DEATH PROGRAM, and the EMERGING, (back from out of the Roman Catholic Inquisitional Dark Ages of murder and mayhem) CHURCH, Now we have, if your marriage is in trouble, turn to a badly written and acted movie for the obvious answer, duh!. Men of 'the church' are being taught to bow down to the flesh of the women of 'the church' with this approach. Make her coffee, send her flowers. ring her for no reason, make her feel 'special', have some chocolates delivered with a Hall Mark card, in fact pander and pander to the flesh rather than preach the Word that commands, (not recommends if everybody has had a good day and the sun is shinning just so, as everybody is eating an ice-cream), that a woman, if she loves the Lord Jesus Christ, submits to her husband as her husband submits to the Lord Jesus Christ to love his wife as he loves his own life. The woman should not be having her 'self esteem' raised by the husband pandering to her fleshly wants and the wife should not be putting up with being patronised by her husband trying to act as if he has just been catching up with all of Ophrah's 'self adoration' philosophies on the tube. Christians need to be taught to go to the Word of God, to get before the LORD in humble prayer, to seek His will on a marriage partner, and on how to maintain a Godly marriage, to turn to the LORD in all matters. But what are we being taught to do? Follow the world! It works for Hollywood so it must work in 'Christendom'. It works for Dr. Phil, so obviously it will work for Fireman Kurt. Yet God tells us again and again to separate from the ways of the world, not seek out the Christian equivalent and peddle that to the worldly church-going masses. (Do you know that this program also promotes remarriage whilst the previous partners are still living? It wasn't in their book, but it's here now! What next? How to Fire Proof you Sodomite marriage?) Christians do not do these imitation HollyWoodStock things well. It always ends up coming across as 'amateurish' making both unbelievers and believers alike cringe deep inside. From all appearances, Kurt is my brother in Christ, and i am thankful to the Lord for that, but Kurt is not a good actor, (praise the Lord), and he's the best thing in the movie, (what does that tell you about the movie?) What can i tell you? America has suddenly become Obama-nation, the Sodomites are storming the gates, the Moslems are preparing for the ultimate check-mate, Israel is being turned on by the nations of the world, including her so-called 'friends' the great apostasy, headed by the Papacy, Rick Warren, Rob Bell, Benny Hinn, Kenneth Hagin and Copeland, Joyce Myers, Jessie Duplantis and Joel Osteen et al'  is gathering momentum and the ecumenical movement is well and truly into the Interfaith movement which, through all of the New Age Bible Per-Versions floating around out there, is preparing the world for the take over of The Antichrist and we are all putting our hopes on the latest 'Christian' movie, (what you mean 'The Shack' didn't save us???) It is time we all grew up in the Lord Jesus Christ and turned to the only solution He ordained: The Holy Bible, (KJV). It is time to redeem the time and repent of all this sinful foolishness, time to stop being ashamed of the power of God unto salvation: the Gospel of Christ, time to stop following the world and start following Christ Jesus. This movie, like all imitations of worldly expression, will do no good at all, it will only appeal to the flesh because it is of the flesh. If you went up to John the Baptist on a Tuesday and asked him to proclaim the will of the Lord, he would have answered you: "REPENT!" If you went up to him the following Saturday and asked him for any news from the LORD, he would have said: "What? I already told you on Tuesday. REPENT!" This proclamation is still the same today because the state of Man is still the same and more importantly, the LORD Himself is the same yesterday, today and forever. It doesn't matter what the problem is, the answer has always been and always shall be the same: The Lord Jesus Christ. Give this turkey a miss and get on your knees and ask for help from the only one who can help. Written with love in Christ Jesus. Anthony Donaghey.

This review is from: Gone with the Wind (DVD)
      
If you look beyond the great acting, the magnificent sets, the sweeping landscapes and breathtaking cinematography, "Gone With the Wind" is little more than a high budget soap opera. Much of the movie is taken up by the very silly and unmoving romance between Scarlett and Rhett, two shallow characters who obviously do not belong together, and the various tragedies which befall them after they enter into a sham of a marriage (although it is often difficult to feel much sympathy for a couple living in lavish mansions). The only thing which sets the film apart from the usual daily soap operas about self-desctructive rich people (besides its budget) is its backdrop of the Civil War. However, if you want to see a historical film which at least partially resembles reality, then do not watch "Gone With the Wind".The picture the movie draws of the pre-Civil War south is an overly romantic one of beauty and wealth and civility. Sure, a very small elite of rich landowners did live a lovely and leisurely life in the old south, much like the one portrayed in the opening of the movie, but this was done on the backs of slaves. However, this film makes the old south look like an unspoiled paradise in which nobody had to work. The only thing spoiling this film's picture of a perfect society is the spoiled-brat attitude of the egocentric Scarlett O'Hara, but she is clearly portrayed as an anomally as other characters try to put up with her antics. After the invaders from the north are shown to impose their way of life upon the south (seemingly by merely introducing industrialization, and the concept of work), Scarlett is faced with a total inability to adapt to the new society. However, with her frequent stirring speeches about never going hungry again (yeah, right, try actually living in poverty for a day or two) her inability to adapt is more a condemnation of the changes caused by the Civil War than an exploration of any weakness in Scarlett's character. Gone are the days of dances in large halls and picnics on vast tree-covered lawns (as the blacks toil under the baking sun in the far-off fields). Instead, we get scenes of poor rich people loading up buggies to move off of their plantations and into mansions inside of cities only blocks away from the (choke) working classes.In case the viewer doesn't quite get the picture of the "injustice" done to the south and thinks "what about the abolition of slavery?", every single black character in the movie is offensively portrayed as lazy, silly, and superstitious caricatures who are devoted to and love their white masters and are lost without them. The fact that "Gone With the Wind" hasn't faced as much widespread condemnation as "Birth of a Nation" with its pro-KKK scenes is rather surprising.The only reason I can figure out that such a worthless and offensive soap opera is still considered so great is that most critics are afraid to contradict decades of praise given to the movie at the risk of seeming to lack taste. I say stop being blinded by expectations or conformity and actually judge the film for what it is.

This review is from: Wall-E (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)
      
I've seen most of the Pixar films. Heck, I own most of them and have seen them several dozen times because, well, I'm a parent. If you're a parent too then you'll know what I'm talking about.
The Incredibles was the best Pixar film made thus far, in my opinion. It also my opinion that WALL-E is the worst so far from Pixar. The simple reason is that it is light on good story and heavy on pro-environmentalist messaging.
Yes, I know this bucks the PC trend of reviewers raving how great this movie is, but honestly, I was bored. My kids thought it was "okay." After my kids saw The Incredibles they were bouncing off the walls and couldn't wait to own it. I don't think they have any interest in ever owning this movie. 
The message of the movie is that your typical overweight hyper-consuming American is killing the earth. This is a futuristic tale of how said fatso yanks have killed said planet, and largely don't care because they're too busy floating around in hover chairs scarfing junk food and watching TV, kind of like a lot of people do now, except in space.
Oh yeah, and there's something about robots who have no identifiable reproductive organs who still want to get it on. Seriously, WALL-E must be into the whole dominatrix thing because Eve packs a heavy-duty laser cannon and ain't afraid to use it.
Now before all the tree huggers freak on me, I'm all for saving the earth. I am not a hyper-consumer and I often run to work instead of drive. When I do drive, it's a 1.6 liter Honda Civic. I think environmental stewardship is important, but I don't want to be guilt tripped into it at a kid's movie.
The Incredibles is everything that this movie was not. The Incredibles is a great tale of a super family who have some righteous butt-kicking adventures and it allows kids and parents alike to escape reality for a while, which is what family movies are supposed to do.
If I wanted to get bummed out about the state of our environment, I'd watch An Inconvenient Truth. 
Pixar needs to stop with trying to insinuate their political agendas into its movies and get back to good old fashioned story telling.

I've spent the last few days struggling to get through this unwieldy tome, only able to read for short periods at a time before my mind clouded over from sheer boredom. I was looking forward to writing this review, but now that I've finished the book and the time has actually come, all I can feel is overwhelmed. There is just so much that is wrong. I'm almost tempted to keep my review to a couple of terse sentences. But I'll write the full version, too; if I can make it through 700-plus pages of literary torture, I'm sure I can write a half-decent review. 
First, the short version: 
Breaking Dawn is awful. Don't buy it. 
And now, the long version: 
*** SPOILERS AHEAD - READ AT YOUR OWN RISK ***
First of all, it seems silly to be warning of spoilers for a book where nothing actually happens.  Someone needs to buy Stephenie Meyer a good book on writing that explains how to construct a plot... and a climax (more on that later).  But a few of some of my bigger complaints have little to do with the way the book was structured and written, and everything to do with the message behind the words. 
I'm pretty open-minded in my views, but I can not honestly condone any of the messages that Meyer puts forth in Breaking Dawn (and, to a lesser extent, the rest of the series). If I had teenage girls who wanted to read this, I would make a concerted effort to dissuade them. Meyer seems to have forgotten who her audience is. So what's so bad with the messages in the book? Where do I start? 
1. Bella gets herself pregnant. Despite the fact that she's only eighteen and that the fetus is killing her from the inside out, she stubbornly and selfishly insists on carrying the baby to term. She survives... but a real teenage girl with a high-risk pregnancy might not. Bella and the baby could have died, and she would have destroyed everyone who loved her. If she really believed she was going to be an immortal and live forever, the threat of eternal hell for having an abortion shouldn't have been an issue.
As if the teenage pregnancy isn't bad enough, Bella also has the most unrealistic baby imaginable. I even caught myself thinking that maybe having a baby wouldn't be so hard. And that's what I find alarming. I'm a grown adult and the book influenced me (momentarily) that way. What are impulsive teenagers going to take from it? Bella's experience was not normal at all; she didn't have to deal with any of the negative aspects of babies. There were no diapers, no 2 AM feedings, no temper tantrums, no post-partum depression. Bella didn't even have to think about supporting the child because her husband is rich. How many real seventeen-year-old husbands can you say that about?
And the way in which Bella was able to get pregnant doesn't even make sense. Vampires don't eat, don't go to the bathroom, don't sweat, don't grow hair... and yet they can somehow produce sperm from their stone testicles. Does Meyer need an anatomy textbook as well as a writing manual? (I'm all for fantasy, but it has to be plausible.) 
One final thought about the baby. Eighteen-year-old girls should not be allowed to name their children, because they come up with stupid names like "Renesmee". The kid's lucky she wasn't named after Edward's biological mother instead of his adoptive one. Then she would have been "Renizabeth". To be perfectly honest, though, I don't think that sounds any dumber. 
2. Too much is made of physical perfection. From what I can see, the only reason that Edward is attracted to Bella is because of her looks, because she's certainly not interesting. She has no hobbies (except sex), and she even turns her nose up at admission to a prestigious university. Eternity is going to get old very fast. But, apparently, Edward doesn't seem to mind because Meyer makes it seem like a guy who can speak half a dozen languages, write music, play the piano, and otherwise improve his mind is going to be satisfied with a dullard like Bella... just as long as he can gaze at her beauty for all eternity. Bella, for her part, seems to know what a dud she is; we hear about her low self-esteem endlessly. And yet, she gets the guy anyway. What kind of message does that send to young women? Physical beauty is all that matters? That's certainly what I took from it (thank goodness I'm old enough to know better). 
3. These vampires are the environment's worst nightmare.  If you're going to be around for centuries, casting aside clothes after one use, driving gas-guzzling sports cars, and taking down large game just to drain the blood... well, you're going to be using up a lot of resources. For creatures who are going to live forever, you'd think they would have a little more foresight. Or maybe I just wanted to see vampires driving a fleet of little electric cars. 
4. And speaking of cars, portraying Bella's child sitting on people's laps in cars is completely irresponsible. I don't care if she's invincible. It doesn't send a good message (Britney Spears, anyone?). Besides... if Bella ever got pulled over, wouldn't it be less conspicuous if her child was buckled in safely?
There were plenty of other things I didn't like, either. Edward's assertion that humans smelled more like carnivores than herbivores was most likely wrong (unless Meyer is assuming that all humans eat as many animal products as Bella did. Honestly, food other than eggs or meat barely crossed her lips. I can't see why she'd smell that good to Edward. With a diet like that, she should have smelled like rotting meat). 
I hated the switch in point of view right in the middle of the book. The descriptions of the wolves patrolling the forest were extremely boring. It almost seemed like a day-by-day account, and nothing was really happening. The switch was also confusing. We're told in that section how other people see Bella.  But it's not consistent with what came before and it was as if we were seeing an entirely different character. 
Oh, and I can't forget the whole imprinting thing.  Why are all these adult wolves imprinting on toddlers? Talk about pedophilic. I don't care that they keep insisting that they have no control over it. There is one person who does have control over it, and that's the author. It would have been weird enough if it had just happened once. But twice? I couldn't get past the feeling that these were pedophiles who were grooming their little victims until they were old enough to actually do something with. For a while, I thought that Jacob might imprint on Leah (or at least on another grown-up). But that would have been inconvenient for Meyer. 
Convenience. That's what this book boils down to, and that's what ultimately makes it fail. Isn't it convenient that Bella (who has no other talents to speak of) possesses the talent that can save them all? Isn't it convenient that, when she finally becomes a vampire, she can restrain herself from killing humans? Isn't it convenient that the point of view shifted in the middle of the book to Jacob's point of view? Isn't it convenient that Alice showed up at the last minute with the one person who might give the Volturi pause? Ohh... don't even get me started on the Volturi. 
I alluded earlier to the fact that this book has a weak plot and climax. I'll correct that statement. It has NO CLIMAX. The Volturi showed up and, aside from barbequing an inconsequential secondary character with a fancy cigarette lighter (or whatever it was), nothing happened. Nothing. They talked their way out of the predicament and left. While that may be the ideal situation to conflict in real life, in literature it just makes for boring reading. The promise of the foreshadowing is shot, and the reader just ends up frustrated. The Volturi had so much potential as villains, and that potential was completely underutilized.  The high point of the story actually came much earlier, when Bella gave birth. By that time, though, I was so frustrated with endless descriptions of wolf patrols and Bella's martyrdom that I just wanted the baby to kill her and Edward to fail. That would have at least been interesting... and I could have saved myself the hours I spent reading the last half of the novel. 
In short, this was a book that appears to glorify teenage marriage and parenthood, encourage disrespect for the environment and resources, and condone pedophilic tendencies... all while nothing actually happens. Bella got everything without having to sacrifice anything, and everyone lived happily forever after. If you must read Breaking Dawn, get it from the library. It irks me no end that my dollars have gone to encourage this sort of garbage to be written.

This review is from: Nights in Rodanthe [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)
      
The chemistry between Richard Gere and Diane Lane periodically appears credible in the new film Nights in Rodanthe, adapted from Nicholas Sparks' novel, but the practicality and reasoning behind nearly all of their actions are unnatural. Borrowing heavily from the epic romance of 1980's Best Picture winner Out of Africa, Nights in Rodanthe fails to develop sense behind a spontaneous love affair between two unlikely candidates. 
Dr. Paul Flanner (Richard Gere) feels responsible for the death of a surgery patient who died from a reaction to anesthesia. In his guilt, he agrees to drive to an isolated beach house in Rodanthe, North Carolina to meet with the husband (Scott Glenn), who has filed a lawsuit against the dispirited doctor. The trip is on the way to his ultimate destination, however, which is to retrieve his son (James Franco) from Equador, where he has moved to in order to distance himself from his disappointment with his father and his poor handling of the fated operation.
Meanwhile, Adrienne Willis (Diane Lane) is struggling with her two young children, who are in turn coping with their parent's recent divorce. Adrienne wants nothing to do with her unfaithful husband Jack (Christopher Meloni) who foments discontent with their children to coerce their mother into allowing him back. When Jack takes the kids for a spell, Adrienne travels to Rodanthe to look after a luxurious inn for her best friend - the same vacation house that Dr. Flanner has booked - leaving the two of them alone to slowly craft a life-changing romance.
The love story that builds from so many tragedies simply isn't convincing. The unmindful, unlucky doctor meets with the distraught mother in a terrifying hurricane - what a perfect setting for romance. Even looking past the uninspired genesis, Nights in Rodanthe doesn't utilize its surprisingly short running time to develop the characters. The audience doesn't have time to become involved in their sudden affair, and the rest of their wooing takes place through voiceovers as they narrate love letters back and forth. 
It's like a sillier version of Out of Africa, but with more crying, less sweeping romance, and more modernized problems for the lovers to contend with. Not as lengthy and noticeably missing a moving soundtrack and score, the story has been done repeatedly (especially from Nicholas Sparks); as a motion picture it is simply not ambitious enough to create a worthwhile movie-going experience.

Although the movie maintains the integrity of the book pretty well, it comes across as a cheap imitation.  Bella stutters and blinks throughout the whole movie, which was VERY annoying.  Some of the scenes were so contrived and cheesy, that one had to laugh.  The movie has enjoyed so much popularity, I think, in part because the actors are very attractive, and it is an anguished love story, with Edward playing the part of the perfect gentleman, every woman's fantasy.  I loved the Twilight saga in book form, but I have to admit that the movie seemed very low budget.  I hope, considering Twilight's success, that with a new director and larger budget, New Moon will be a production of higher quality and standards.  Still, Twilight isn't bad if your looking to kill a few hours with silly entertainment in the movie theater.

I purchased MacSpeech Dictate and too had the "crash on creating a new profile" problem. Basically it turned out the company was issuing defective, encrypted data disks. Once I got through to the company by their phone line (emails to support went unanswered), they promised me a replacement disk by FedEX. Well, a week later I got the replacement disk!
So I fired up Dictate today and started "training" it on my voice. It came to the end of training and said it was ready to go. I then tried saying a few simple things into Microsoft Word. It got the first few words and then really couldn't recognize anything after that. It seems less-capable than iListen of two years ago. The software, in fact, cannot recognize me saying COMMA at all! Software seems like an ALPHA rather than a 1.0 version of anything. My recommendation is don't buy until there is a 2.0 release, if then. 
Oh and yes, I am using a "certified" headset. Would have been real nice for them to have a page listing certified headsets rather than just me having to go through press releases to find headset-certification announcements! mz

TurboTax Deluxe 2008 does not support investments so if you bought or sold stocks, you must get premier. This is unlike previous years. It seems that they tried to sneak several things in to get more money. Until recently (after many complaints) they were charging you to print your taxes on your own printer. so if you wanted a paper copy or to give it a lookover, more $$$ for Intuit. At a certain point you have to wonder if it is worth it. By the way, I also called the company to verify. This program is designed with hidden charges and less functionality than previous editions. As such, if you want to be nickle and dimed, buy this product. I know what I am going to do, return my product.

READ THIS REVIEW AND AVOID A COSTLY MISTAKE
- Save your money and keep your Mach 3
- Replacement blades don't last as long as the one that comes with the razor, this is a pervasive complaint and something I've also determined when I buy a  new razor handle and blade when traveling versus the replacement blades.
- The blade is so fat, you can't use it under the nose for the mustache, this is why it comes with the "single precision blade" cause their focus group told them the same thing, instead of improving it they just gave you a single blade razor on your five blade overpriced replacement.
- Blades are too close to clean, you'll waste a gallon of water just trying to free cut hair from between the blades, THE MORE WATER YOU RUN THE BLADE UNDER THE QUICKER YOU OXIDIZE THE CUTTING SURFACE AND RUIN THE BLADE / SO GO BUY MORE REPLACEMENTS.
- Another reviewer said it and it is true, you can interchange the Power and Manual versions so if you insist on using this razor, you can buy THE MANUAL VERSION replacement for the Fusion Power handle.
- Save your money, and keep your Mach 3 !!!!

Transporter is such an amazing film, a real surprise, great timing, interesting story, and just the right amount of action. Fast forward to version 3, and everything just feels wrong.
The opening 10 or 15 minutes pack some interesting story line, decent action, that car crashing through Frank's living room wall was incredible. From there the film just goes down hill. The real turning point, Frank starts talking to Valentina (breaks his rule about the cargo), and she refuses to speak (invoking his rule about not talking). Finally she talks about food at a restaurant. It's foreshadowing, but she does talk about carrots a lot. And sadly the only thought this reviewer and his two sons had was, well does that help her keep her red hair and freckles? Sad but true, the movie just completely lost it's way at this point.
The action scenes are exciting and pitiful at the same time. The excitment is in the chase and the rapid fire editing, slick cars, beautiful scenery, and pulsating music and sound. The awful part, and this absolutely kills these sequences, so much sped up motion was used as to make these scenes almost stupid. Sped up and slo-mo fighting scenes were tiresome. The worst was the driving on two wheels between the two semi's stunt - plain old, flat out, stupid, defying all laws of physics and the darn CG effect was too obvious. 
It's a sad movie when the viewer can actually see the light green tint around the edge of the actors in front of a green screen (just about every in car conversation is plagued with this). If the action had been furious enough, the dialog compelling, the story interesting; the green screen effect would have faded away. Instead it's out there in the open, made even visible on Blu-Ray.
There's a ton of continuity issues, where things don't match from one scene to the next. Frankly, this reviewer has never seen a longer list for any other movie that that internet movie database. T 3 has probably set a record for the most (there are over 30 goofs). 
Natalya Rudakova is just not a very good actress, her delivery of lines is flat and almost read from the script. She is not really that beautiful, certainly not somebody that Frank should be attracted to. The reviewer found himself noticing the dark marks on her lips, either cold sores or freckles. It's very sad when a lead actress just isn't captivating. Jason Statham is the only reason this film gets two stars. This is essentially a guy movie, not really a date film. Jason taking his shirt off several times, well just wasn't a smart move; it plays to the wrong audience. The fishing scene with the French police inspector is charming. Him driving an old Renault 6 is also an interesting contrast. The other characters are just flat.
The film is rated PG-13. There is no nudity. The f bomb is in a subtitle once. There's plenty of violence, a fair amount of blood, and several times where a person is shown being shot. Given that the movie is so bad, it's probably smart to respect the age guideline. 
Blu-Ray was a mixed blessing for this film. The sound is incredible. It will excercise your subwoofer. The gun shots and fighting sounds are significantly higher volume than the dialog. The high resolution of Blu-Ray shows all the bad / cheap CG effects the director chose. On DVD, these might not have been as visible. 
The Blu-Ray disc includes some really lame Mogolo (apologies for not spelling this correctly) piece of junkware software. It took a good solid 15 minutes (at 12Mbps very fast internet connection) to download the program. It appears to allow a person to view a clip of the film, store it, add some graphics, and then share it with others. After step 12 in the demo, this reviewer gave up totally. Cr__ware experiments just keep happening with Blu-Ray. Maybe one day soon the authors of this junk will settle down to just show the movie in all it's HiDef glory.

I bought this item for my wife, who has multiple sclerosis. She's trying to keep track of her walking distances and the number of steps she takes. Because her gait is awkward, by normal standards, and her pace is very slow, the Omron device is not able to accurately track her steps or distance. Although the unit works fine (I tested it myself), it does not work for the person who wanted it and could have benefited from it the most.

I've been purchasing with Amazon.com for nine years and this product is so awful I feel compelled to write my first review.  The packaging implies you'll be connected within minutes.  The product offers no manual whatsoever and only an installation disk.  The disk prompts you on which cords to unhook from your current router and where to plug them in on your new router, and then prompts you to turn on the router.  The prompt icon spins for over ten minutes only to tell you there is no connection to the Internet.  There isn't a word of technical support provided other than "make sure everything is plugged in."  
If I didn't want my money back, I'd use this piece of junk as a paperweight.  
Please note that I wasn't able to leave no stars.  One star is far too good a rating and I apologize for any miscommunication.  Worst. Purchase. Ever.

This review is from: Transformers (DVD)
      
Warning: Only for Transformers fans! I should never have bought this DVD, replete with potholes so large the whole thing could fall into another dimension. Jon Voight, John Turturro, Shia LaBeouf, and Josh Duhamel do what they can with this shallow material, earning enough to buy more cars and summer homes. Do yourself a favor and get any "Riddick" film, or the superb "Equilibrium" instead. This kid stuff degenerates into fantasy disguised as Sci-Fi, covered up by layers of special effects.
The best role is that of "Mojo," a broken-legged Chihuahua who would have saved the film if he'd been the sole story. Ultimately, the Cube is a big "so what," and the Transformers, supposedly beings of higher intelligence, call themselves ridiculous names like Optimus Prime. 
Schmaltz Alert: A good laugh derived from a scene so filled with Spielbergian Schmaltz as to seem a Spielberg Parody. But no, in the corny School of Spielberg, director Michael Bay delivers a scene with: a tiny blonde girl, a purple "My Pony," and a bag placed under a pillow labeled "My Tooth." But it can't stop there, on no, she must simper and ask one of the clumsy, unscary aliens, "Are you the Tooth Fairy?" Spare yourself.

For those of us parents who were expecting a movie as thoroughly enjoyable as Toy Story or Monsters Inc., which was highly entertaining for both the parents AND their preschool-aged children, this was a HUGE disappointment. None of us--my husband, I, and our children--enjoyed the movie. Having 3 little boys, I was excited by the prospect of a movie about robots made by Pixar. What better combination, I thought. Unfortunately, the movie is not about Wall-E or his story. It's about staring at the earth filled with mountains of garbage and watching a nearly personality-less robot make these mountains of garbage for extremely long periods of time. Since when have I ever sat in a movie theater and thought..."Okay, surely the story is going to start any moment" only to find out it never does? This is a first! Pixar failed miserably in utilizing a potentially great character to weave a cautionary tale--they wasted Wall-E! Instead of inspiring the spirit to take care of the earth, Pixar has nearly satirized the environmentalist message through the painfully long landscape scenes and lack of plot. The movie belabors the obvious. The robots are uninteresting and barely qualify as characters. Wall-E lacks the humor, excitement, and classic story-telling techniques I have come to expect from Pixar. This movie is certainly outside Pixar's box, and for that reason we were terribly disappointed.

I wish I could give this a no star rating. When I got this mixer I loved it! It was quiet and efficient.  But i used it for a litte more than a year and rarely at that.  I didn't even use it once a month.  Now it's dead and just refuses to turn on.   I should have paid attention to the reivews when I bought it but I didn't, now I'm stuck and the company refuses to do anything. The one I had previos to this one was not even a major brand I picked up at the local Wal-Mart for about $10.  It lasted for about 15 years.

This is the third Waterpik I've ordered. This one disappoints. The pressure is lower than my previous one. The water container is smaller and usually has to be refilled to finish the job. It is smaller overall and fits in the bathroom much easier, but if you want performance look for the previous model or wait until Waterpik fixes this one.

I do not recommend this microwave.  I have to say that this slightly pricey microwave, compared to other brands and models, look really classy with its shiny touches.  It's a nice looking microwave, but that's about it.  This microwave gives off a loud buzzing sound during cooking and the door is a bit loose around the hinges.  The door can literally be shaken while the door is closed.  Another issue I have with it is that it cooks much slower than the microwave I have at work.  When I cook a TV dinner platter, the food is never heated in accordance to the time the box says it should cook (even when I use the maximum recommended time).  When I microwaved the same type of TV dinner at work (a smaller microwave model), it cooked at the minimum recommended cooking time.  With this Sharp R-216LS, I always have to add an extra minute to the recommended cooking time--a waste of energy.  Luckily I don't use the microwave for much except once in a blue moon TV dinner.

I bought this mouse as a replacement for my Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer which I've had for almost 8 years now. It finally developed a short in the cord and cuts out occasionally. Other then that it still works perfectly. Imagine my disappointment when right out of the box I noticed that the bottom button bellow the mouse wheel on the Habu stuck in the down position the very first time it was depressed. Definitely not the quality I was expecting.
I decided to go ahead and try to install it anyway. I was really curious to see if it was as tough as everyone is saying. IT IS!!! I consider myself pretty good with computers. I have built several of them. This was by far the toughest install I've dealt with. Even with following some instructions I found on the internet step by step, it still failed to recognize the mouse and upgrade the firmware. I finally had success (quite by accident) after uninstalling the Habu software, installing the software update from razer and then flashing the firmware. Basically follow the instructions in Adams review and you should be fine. I wish I had read them before wasting 3 hours of my life.
So now it works. How good is it? The mouse itself is very comfortable. I like the interchangeable side buttons. I opted for the buttons further to the rear. The scroll wheel and left and right buttons all work fine and have a nice feel to them. The major complaint I have is with the two buttons below the wheel. The bottom one sticks and even the top button has a "cheap" feeling click to it. The tracking for the cursor is very smooth and precise.
Now on to the software. The UI is ugly and tacky but is fairly straight forward and easy to figure out. The biggest disappointment here is with the standard options for the buttons. There are no options for forward, back, close or minimize. All of these were available on my 8 year old mouse. I ended up having to make and assign macros to each button to get everything to work the way I wanted. The macros function itself was a bit buggy. Sometimes they would work and sometimes not. After redoing them several times it seems to have "taken" and is working OK. It's just allot of hassle to go through to get to what I feel should be a standard option.
Amazon is sending me a replacement. I will see if the sticky button was just a fluke. 
Pros: 
Nice Looking
Comfortable
Excellent tracking and precision
Cons: 
Extremely difficult install
Sticky button "cheap" feel
Lack standard options for button assignments
Expensive
Lack of tech support

I purchased the 320gb Iomega "prestige" drive against my better judgment since I have recently had poor results from Iomega drives (two failures in three months.) This drive is not prestigious but is instead a low end poorly made drive. The usb female port in the drive is poorly made and does not hold onto the male end of the cable. I could I suppose attach some electrical tape to the cable and try to secure it to the drive, but that sounds like a poor choice when we're talking about important date transfers. So I called customer service, they said, sorry, we can only exchange the device (no refunds) and I had to pay the return charges. Tried to speak to a supervisor, but he was "unavailable" (after a five minute hold). These are tough times and those sort of answers are a clear signal (along with a shoddily  produced product) that Iomega is not the company that one wants to use these days for data storage. So potential buyers BEWARE.

I own an older version of this product, and its performance has been stellar over the years. However, I have needed a replacement bowl cover and bowl for many months because the bowl cover is coming apart at the rim (something that happened fairly early on, I might add) and the bowl's safety mechanism is missing the appropriate stop making it a matter of having to hold the lid in place with one hand while pushing food through the chute with the other, otherwise the cover slips out of place and the processor shuts off. Worse still is when the bowl cover slips past the broken off stop, making the lid impossible to remove without inserting a small screw driver and manually pushing the safety lever in the handle of the bowl down while sliding the lid back into place. Since they are no longer actively manufacturing my version, which is less than seven years old, I have found it impossible to find a replacement for the bowl cover, which I know has been on back-order since at least May of 2007. Kitchenaid promised replacements by January of 2008, and now has revised the date to April 2008. You should be aware, if you purchase one of these products, that replacement parts may be exceedingly difficult to obtain as your processor gets older. This may be true of other brands as well, I don't know, but I have finally decided to give up waiting for my replacement parts to come and have purchased another food processor OF ANOTHER BRAND. I know one thing, I will NEVER buy another Kitchenaid product, based on how poorly they have handled this backorder issue. And I am not alone. There is a huge backorder for the bowl cover, so it is a design flaw they cannot overcome and will not admit to, in my estimation. Instead they leave their customers hanging in limbo with no answers and no way to make full use of one of their products, and a fairly expensive one at that. Beware.

I have been a user of Turbo Tax for over 10 years.  What TT needs to know is that customer loyalty is built on providing a consistent product at a reasonable price.  For example, if I purchase TT Deluxe year after year I expect that product to have the same or increased functions.  I should not find out after I purchase the product that it no longer supports Sched D or C or that I now have to pay to print additional returns for my children.  I HAVE HAD IT WITH TT!!! I am using TaxCut for 2008 and it imported my 2007 TT data and it works just fine at less cost.

I purchased this D-Link DIR-655 router to replace a failing Netgear unit that was about 4 years old.  I purchased it after reading rave reviews in several technical publications, including Maximum PC Magazine.  I have spent numerous hours of my time, and the time of my more tech-savvy friends, trying to get it to work - at all.  The symptom I experience is that I can see the router, and get into it's setup, etc., but I cannot see or get any access at all to the internet.
I have had tech support on a call for over 1 hour from D-Link, who claim the problem is with my ISP.  I have had my ISP tech staff on a call twice, for over an hour who cannot really help because a) it's not a router I am renting from them (though they supply d-Link themselves, but not this model), and b) since there is no connectivity at all, they cannot remote-link in and see what is going on.  They claim it's some conflict between the router and something else running on my system - but not their problem since I can connect directly without any router - which does make some sense.  I have downloaded the firmware and upgraded it; actually replaced it since my device shipped with the most current version supposedly already loaded.  All to no avail.
At this point, I have worked so long on this that I can no longer return it to Amazon.  As part of this experience, I have also looked at a LOT of blogs and have found that my experience is NOT unique with this device.  Many who are clearly more technical than I am have been unable to get thgis device to work, or work reliably.  The concensus is "buy something else". In that regard, the only recommendation seems to be "buy Cisco" - which works fine for those wbale/willing to pay $1K+ for a router - I cannot.
I am going back to Netgear, though, again, the Blogs are not very comforting in terms of the the "N Gigabit" model from them either.
Amazon should NOT sell this device till D-Link gets their act together with the product, and their technical support of the product.

Linksys and all other router manufacturers advertises the greatness of the wireless 5ghz band (especially with 802.11n), but I'm beginning to have my doubts.  It is true that the 5Ghz band is hardly being used so you'll have virtually no one to compete with,.  However, the 5Ghz distance in no way compares to 2.4Ghz, and as a matter of fact, I find it to be quite terribe.  At approximately 20 feet away, both my Linksys DMA2200 and HP notebooke barely get 1 bar using the 5Ghz N band with my WRT610N router.  In comparison, while only using my 2.4Ghz WRT54g router, I get 5 full bars at that range, and at least 2 bars from anywhere else in my house. 
I have all Linksys equipment in my house as I have been impressed with all of their 2.4Ghz in the past.  However, I've recently upgraded everything to dual-band N equipment and found numerous flaws in each of the new devices, plus none of them really even play well together.  My setup is: Linksys 610n router, DMA2200 media center extender, and a WUSB600N Dual-Band Wireless-N USB Network Adapter for my laptop - all of which are currently using the most up-to-date firmware. Other devices include a WRE54G extender and  Nintendo Wii.
Problem  #1) The LELA software with the new N devices doesn't even recognize that my DMA2200 is a media center extender.  Using LELA, I should be able to select my media extender and allocate more bandwidth for streaming media.  However, since my extender only shows up as an "unknown network device" those options are greyed out.  I tried to manually change the device to a media center, but still no go.  I suppose you can manually allocate bandwidth in the router setup somewhere, but considering these are all Linksys products, it's absolutely ridiculous that an option specifically incorporated in the LELA software for a Linksys Media Extender does not work!!!  
Problem #2) If you are only using one system with the router, the router might actually work as intended.  For most of us though there are going to be at least 2 or more systems connected to the router (wired, wireless, or a combination of the two) such as a PS3, Wii, laptop, PC, media extender, Xbox, etc.  If that's the case, you're probably screwed because you WILL experience frequent dropouts... ESPECIALLY if just one those clients is a VISTA machine.   Check the linksys forums and you will find that this seems to be a problem with all of the new linksyss routers (610N, 310N, and 110).  Here is a microsoft article that explains the problem [...] do to a problem with the way VISTA accepts DHCP requests from certain routers.  Unfortunately, there is no real fix for this, even with the suggested registry modification which really doesn't fix the problem.
Problem #3) Because of  problem #2 I will never be able to get rid of the dropouts since my network is using one of Linksys's media center extenders.  The DMA2200 is essentially a VISTA PC to some extent and accepts DHCP requests the same as a VISTA PC.  Since it is not really a PC though, there is no registry modification that can be done to alleviate the VISTA problem (not hat the registry mod really works anyways).  So as long as I try to use my DMA2200 wirelessly with my WRT610N router, the frequent dropouts will occur and there's nothing I can do about it.  This is REALLY TERRIBLE since the DMA2200 is specifically designed to be used with the WRT610N router in order to take advantage of the 5Ghz band and wireless N transfer rates.  You absolutely need 5Ghz wireless N to effeciently stream HDTV WIRELESSLY, but if you lose your connection every 10 minutes, it is impossible to watch any type of streaming media.
Problem #4) As mentioned already, when the "N" 5Ghz range is working on the WRT510N router, the distance sucks compared to standard 2.4Ghz G, N or mixed mode networks.  You can try to make it better by strictly using N products, disabling the 2.4ghz band all-to-gether, and using the wider 40mhz frequency, but it doesn't really help.  The higher 5Ghz band is a more concentrated signal and therefore simply does not reach as far as the lower 2.4ghz band.  I wonder why all of these new products state that the 5Ghz range will increase your distance, when in fact it actually makes it worse?  
So... basically, this router does nothing that it claims too and is basically rendered useless on any network with a VISTA machine.  This has not been addressed by any Linksys firmware updates or VISTA software updates so there is no reason to even consider using this router if you you're using VISTA or some type of VISTA Media Center Extender such as the Linksys DMA2200. 
Although, I've always sworn by Linksys in the past, the amount of wasted time, frustration, and horrible support has really changed my view about them.  I've reverted back to my old trustworthy WRT54g router and had to run cable through my house so that I wouldn't have to box my DMA2200 extender up and let it collect dust in the attic.  It's really disappointing that I spent all this money to buy this equipment specifically because they're supposed to work together, but in fact they don't.  Plus what's the point of having top notch wireless equpment if you have to run cables in order for them to work?

Using TT Deluxe 2008, I imported my 2007 Taxcut information and then proceeded to enter most of my 2008 data.  However, when I attempted to enter in that I received a 2007 state refund which should be taxable because I itemized on my Federal return in 2007, Turbotax indicated that I did not itemize in 2007.  There is no way to correct this information in Turbotax short of redoing my entire return (according to the support person I spoke with on the phone).  Based on posts on Intuit's "Live Community" many others are experiencing this problem.

The Kingston 1GB DataTraveler flash drive is very cheap -- it can often be found for free after rebate.  It's small and convenient, but speed is quite lacking.  Copying files takes a long time.  Worse, I just found out it cannot be used for Windows Vista's ReadyBoost feature (which speeds up system performance) because it's too slow.

I bought this product based on mostly good reviews written here.  After using it for a few weeks I'm disappointed.
First, it's erratic.  The heart rate bounces around in a huge range.
Second, it only gives a reading about half the time, and that reading is often so erratic it can't be believed.  I know you have to moisten the sensor areas, but I've done that and it doesn't help much.  In an intense workout where I'm sweating a lot, it gives a more consistent readout, but still not 100%.  If I keep using it I'm going to have to buy some kind of lube to apply on the sensors so I can get a more consistent readout.
Bottom line:  I'm very disappointed in this purchase, and wish I'd spent a few dollars more to get something marginally decent.

I've been wanting to try one of these collars for a while, and finally decided on this one. I was kind of disappointed, but then again, I guess you get what you pay for. I can never get this thing to work properly on a continual basis. It seems to have a mind of it's own on if it will work or not. Just testing before even putting the collar on my dog, 6 time out of 10 it wouldn't work (testing the tone)
The push button for the on/off could have been designed better, and the buttons on the remote are kind of sensitive. Just slightly pressing the button, the light would come on, but not send a signal to the collar.
I wouldn't buy this again. But maybe I just got a bad unit

Fortunately this product was cheap because I am just going to throw it away.  It makes a big mess in the kitchen, spitting water and rice liquids all over the counter.  I only tried to make 2 cups (cooked) but it still just bubbled up and ran all over everything.  Maybe it was the sticky rice but I tried others and it did the same thing.  It is not worth the trouble to send back.

Small, looks great, quiet, it's everything you want in an external drive.  Just don't turn it off.  Each time it turned off, whether manually or by power failure, I could not get the drive to turn back on.  The button does not work.  One review said WD told him to hit the box as the power switch hangs up.  If I hit is a few times, it lights up as if there was no problem.  This is not the way a $200+ device should operate.  I have no confidence in this drive as a backup. 
January 28 Update... It has been one week and five business days since I asked WD about the problem with the My Book Studio Edition.  Despite two follow up notes to them and a claim of one day response to most questions, there has been no response.  If I could edit the stars the rating would now drop to one star.

I would not order anything else from Amazon.  I have been an Amazon customer since they started and I also was a share holder.  After the experience that I had in retuning a used product sold to me as new and then replace it when I did not order it and charge me for the shipping, I realized that Amazon is no longer the company that I had done business with all these years.
Order from Amazon, but if you have to return an item, you are going to experience something new.

I saw this film purely on great buzz. It made many 'top 10' lists in 2008 and I was curious about this film that I'd never heard of. I never saw a trailer and all I had to go on was a couple of wonderful reviews and a small blurb of a synopsis.
I am very open-minded when it comes to film. I love the horror genre as well as anything to do with vampires. And I usually like foreign horror. But I admit I was entirely dissapointed in Let The Right One In. It starts out promising but after that I felt nothing for the film, nor its characters.
This is not a horror film and should not be labeled as such. I'm not even talking about shock and gore. I'm talking about atmosphere. It was lacking. There was no sense of foreboding, no real mystery, nothing that made your spine tingle. 
Yes, it is a romance of sorts and while it may be interesting in that regard, it still felt lacking. The main problem is that there is no backstory to the character of Eli. She is a vampire and she is 12 and has been for quite a while. That's all we know. I did some research after the film and found out from people that read the actual book what exactly happens to her. Her backstory sounded more heartbreaking than this entire film.
Without it, Eli was just a mysterious little vampire with an ambiguous past. 
The acting was pretty good and I thought the actors who portrayed Eli and the bullied Oskar did a great job in that regard. When Eli very briefly reveals something pretty darn important about her past, it is not questioned by Oskar for even a second. Not even the fact that she is a vampire deters him or makes him blink. Some would call that sweet and romantic. I would call it unrealstic in any case. 
I appreciate what the director was trying to accomplish, and maybe the actual book is very good, but as a movie, it feels very lacking and the ending leaves much to be desired. I swear Oskar's fate will be just like Eli's other caretaker/father/whatever he was supposed to be. And that is hardly what I would call a love story.

My wife and I are very busy, so we were looking for a quick convenient way to brew a good cup of coffee.  This machine is quick and easy, but it is the weakest coffee I have ever had.  This machine seems to follow suit with the latest fad of flavored waters.  I read all the good reviews posted here and can only figure the people writing these reviews either work for the company, or have never had a good cup of coffee.  Don't buy this machine it is a waste of money and time.

I enjoyed the first Madagascar, even though in places I thought it just a wee bit inappropriate for children.
For the second installment, the producers seem to have zoomed in on all the moderately offensive bits of the first, and blown them way out of proportion in the second.  I guess they are just doing what anyone who wants to make money will do: pander to base human nature.  
But this is aimed at kids, and I kinda draw the line there.
The movie has several instances of suggestive sexual inuendo that go way beyond the border of acceptability for children. 
And top it off with the "misunderstood, underappreciated dancer gets to save the day with his 'art'...", and a clearly male character who not just suggests gener role reversal, but three times while dressed in women's "attire" says "I'm a lady..." and "Which of you is attracted to me?"
And a "hunky hunky hippo" getting his Fabio groove on, coming up out of the water with closeups of his "hairy muscular chest" and "tight (but large) 'buns'...", and suggestive music with lyrics like "I like 'em big... I like 'em chunky.  I like 'em big. I like 'em plumpy...  I like 'em spunky..."
Can someone please tell me who, at DreamWorks, thought this would be good for children?
And while it's true (like everyone says) that the Penguins definately delivered in this movie, that's just not enough to prevent this being a single-rent DVD for us.

We are now at the stage 4 and the diapers have become amazingly leaky.  This wasn't much of a problem for smaller sizes but on this stage the diapers leak 80% of the time (easily 4 leaks out of 5 changes).  We were travelling and had to use the usual global brands (Pampers and the like) and we were amazed how so much more reliable they were compared to the Seventh Generation.
We had no problems at earlier stages and are happy about the baby wipes.

Don't buy this if you think your power will ever go out, or you might pull the plug.
My hard drive was getting full. I had lots of family photos and music files and various other stuff.  So i bought the Western Digital 500GB My Book and 'moved' 62G of files onto it.  A week later I go to find something and there are no, zero nada files on it.  I do notice that the drive letter shows that there is only 420GB free.  First help person says, did you ever unplug it.  Sure I say, afterall it's a hard drive like the one in your PC you should be able to turn off power.  He says oh your data is gone then!!!! 
I tell him that there must be something on there taking up that space but he doesn't understand me so i ask him to escalate (we're dealing with India now).  Finally after several hours and requests to escalate since I know there is data on there, I get a very smart person who understands right away what i am saying regarding only 420GB free, must be data on the drive.  He has me run some sort of scan and it finds all my files!!!! Whoohoo right?
Wrong, it just finds the data, and gives them new filenames like 000001.chk, 000002.chk, 000003.cha and so on for 30,000 files or so.  The help desk guy then sympathises and recommends some software, you can purchase, that will go through all the files and put the correct extensions on them.
So hour and days later i have 3,000 .txt files with no names, and 2,000 .jpg files and 5,000 .ppt .... and so on.  Now i get to open each one and name it appropriately.
Do you want to go through this experience?  If you have no fear that your power will ever go out, or you'll accidently pull the plug then go ahead, buy it.
I do own a Maxtor exernal for my other PC, 2 years now, multiple power downs and no data loss.
